    Paul Houghton pointed out that the FQCN comment should not be instructing
    Category subclass developers to ""override"" the FQCN field; especially
    since they can't (the field is private static final).  Rather, subclass
    developers should be creating their own private static final version of
    FQCN to ensure that forcedLog uses the appropriate one.

    CVS version 1.27.  This modified version supports java.io.Reader objects in
    the method doConfigure(), instead of only InputStream.
    org.xml.sax.InputSource supports a constructor which takes a Reader object,
    so the change is very simple:
    
    
    - modified the existing doConfigure(InputStream, Hierarchy) method to
    doConfigure(InputSource, Hierarchy) and made it protected instead of public.
    - created a new public version of doConfigure(InputStream,Hierarchy) which
    calls doConfigure(InputSource, Hierarchy).
    - created a new public method, doConfigure(Reader, Hierarchy), which calls
    doConfigure(InputSource, Hierarchy).
    
    
    That's it.  I needed this modification because I have a case where the xml
    configuration data is coming from a string, not a file.  So I need to use
    the java.io.StringReader class to wrap the existing string.

    Java2. If that fails, search for ""resource"" using the class loader
    that loaded this class (Loader). Under JDK 1.1, only the the class
    loader that loaded this class (Loader) is used.
    
    Try one last time with ClassLoader.getSystemResource(resource)</code>,
    that is is using the system class loader in JDK 1.2 and virtual
    machine's built-in class loader in JDK 1.1.
    
    The difference with the previous code was that under Java2, the
    classloader of org.apache.log4j.helpers.Loader was *not* tried if the
    thread context loader was set. However, this is incorrect logic becase
    Thread.getContextClassLoader always returns a value.
    
    Thread.getContextClassLoader javadoc reads:
    
       Returns the context ClassLoader for this Thread. The context
       ClassLoader is provided by the creator of the thread for use by code
       running in this thread when loading classes and resources. If not set,
       the default is the ClassLoader context of the parent Thread. The
       context ClassLoader of the primordial thread is typically set to the
       class loader used to load the application.
    
    If an application server chooses not to set the thread context class
    loader, then Thread.getContextClassLoader returns the ""classpath""
    classloader which usually not what is desired.

    LoggerEventListener. I also cleaned up dependent code in o.a.l.jmx
    package.
    
    - Removed the allAppendersRemovedEvent from the LoggerEventListener
    interface because from the listener's point of view it is simpler to
    consider the removal of *all* appenders as a succession of single
    appender removes. Moreover, since the number of appenders attached to
    any given logger is usually small, the potential performance gains in
    doing wholesale treatment is low.
    
    - Added dev16 as author in Hierarchy.java and
    LoggerRepository.java. In Hierarchy.java, moved the list of
    contributors out of the javadocs back to the top of the file.
    
    - Made a number of indentation changes, using the pattern:
    
      public
      static
      void foo() {...
    
    changed to

    Chainsaw is now capable of remembering the size and position of the main
    window, the position of the table/details divider, the width and order
    of all the columns, whether or not each column is displayed, the state
    of the filtes and a recent files list.  The number of files in the
    recent files list is configurable, as is the whether the state of the
    filters is preserved.  These preferences are accessible from the
    File->Preferences menu option.  The preference dialog also allows the
    user to select which columns are shown.  Mnemonic shortcuts have been
    added to all menu items.  The recent files submenu is under the File
    menu.  The preferences are stored under the user's home directorey by
    default but the preference file and any individual preference may be
    overridden by the system properties.  Chainsaw will handle the absence
    of the preferences file by creating it; no errors should arise from any
    preference not being defined.

    - The o.a.l.helpers.PatternParser class has been moved to
     o.a.l.pattern package.
    
    Many of the small PatternConverter classes contained in
    PatternParser.java  file have been taken out  and placed in
    o.a.l.pattern package as  independent class files.
    
    The Layout class has changed. A new method
    
      void format(Writer output, LoggingEvent event)
    
    has been added. Instead of returning a String, Layouts now write
    directly to the output stream. This significantly improves performance,
    in particular by avoiding the  creation of many temporary strings.
    
    The  method
    
      String  format(LoggingEvent event)
    
    in Layout is kept around for compatibility. This method is now
    implemented in terms of the format(Writer, LoggingEvent) variant
    where Writer is a CharArrayWriter.
    
    The changes pass the existing unit tests.

    from the use of Vectors for event information, into native LoggingEvent
    objects.
    
    The ChainsawAppenderHandler now does no conversion
    of the incoming events, but bundles them up into batches
    and dispatches them to listeners, leaving it up to the
    listener to do any needed conversion as necessary.
    
    LogUI and LogPanel are now a little more decoupled.  LogUI
    now has an inner helper class that is a batch listener that is
    there purely to listen for new pane identifiers and create
    new LogPanels as necessary.
    
    LogPanel now implements the event batch listener interface
    and gets added as listener on creation time and from that
    point on is responsible for receiving it's own events.
    
    At this point LogPanel still decodes/formats each LoggingEvent
    into a Vector as a final step, but that will change shortly-ish.

    * locationinfo - non-log4j apps may only specify a subset of the locationinfo fields (the rest would be null), a check was added to prevent an NPE on each accessor
    * loggingevent - Added locationInformationExists method (getLocationInfo creates a location info if it does not exist), and added exist checks to code as needed to prevent location info construction
    * loggingevent - modified setProperty behavior, if value is null, the property is removed
    * receiverpanel - add xmlsocketreceiver support(built-in support for reception of xml-formatted log4j events via tcp socket)
    * utillogginglevel - modified intvalues so that the lowest value is greater than log4j's debug level intvalue (so the appender skeleton would forward the events correctly with threshold set to debug)
    * fileloadaction - when attempting to load an xml file, directories are displayed as well as xml files
    * modified thread code in chainsawappenderhandler in an attempt to improve performance
    * multicastappender/udpappender - removing internally specified properties (log4japp/log4jmachine name) so the rest of the appenders in the appender chain could specify these properties themselves or the default behavior of using the remote machine could be used
    * multicastappender/receiver, udpappender/receiver added encoding support (chartset) as a property.  If none set, the default system encoding is used.
    * xmlsocketreceiver/udpreceiver/multicastreceiver - added pausable support (useful in receiver panel)

    * implemented support for expression-based color rules and a colorpanel UI for building the expressions and defining the colors.  Colors aren't yet written to disk so color support is a work in progress, but seems very usable.
    * updated welcomepanel load process to avoid null pointer in html load step
    * modified rules to clarify parameters, increased visibility where necessary
    * refactored expression rule context (a popup menu which assists in building rule expressions) and added support in colorpanel UI

    use the new isEquivalent(Plugin) method seems to have
    missed the comparison check of the class of each
    Plugin.  I have modified this to be inline with what the

    the user usually deals with.  Saves having to bother with that NoReceiver warning dialog for users
    who are using Chainsaw frequently.
    
    This is somewhat of a duplicate effort to what the 'log4j.configuration' option would do
    but exposes the functionality via the GUI.
    
    The ApplicationPreferenceModelPanel is getting a bit messy now.  Might need to rethink
    how this is structured to make it easier to add changable properties to the GUI.
    
    Right now if you type a dud URL into the text field it is not 'accepted', but there is no visual
    clue that it has been rejected.  In fact, while the underlying preference model does not accept
    the change, the GUI seems to keep the value, which will be confusing!  :(
    
    I hope to add some decoration to indicate when the value entered has been accepted and
    to properly discard any old values correctly on Cancel.

    Code compiles, Chainsaw can run, and tested Tutorial receivers etc, seems to work pretty well.
    
    HOWEVER, found 2 issues during this still to be resolved.
    
    1) Any Receiver started by the automatic external configuration file APPEAR in the Receiver Tree,
    and can be stopped, but the GUI does not remove the visual node from the tree, which is confusing.
    I have left that as a TODO.
    
    2) Stopping the Tutorial causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException within Swing, possibly
    because the removal of the tree node is not being done in the correct thread, or something. Not sure yet.

    Stephen Pain noticed that when a Receiver is restarted in Chainsaw, the GUI looks fine, but no events are displayed
    from that point onwards.  A real bummer.
    
    It turns out that it is during the restart of Socket based Receivers, an LoggingEvent is sent through
    describing the socket close issue.  Unfortunately the event has no properties set.
    
    Currently the LoggingEvent.getProperties() method could return null.  It might be worth changing this so that
    it return an empty Map instead, but I was not prepared to make that call right now.
    
    I might also consider checking out why the Thread that gets that NPE causes Chainsaw to become useless, it
    should try and deal with those sort of issues in much the same way as the Swing EventDispatch thread does, it
    seems to go merrily along even after exceptions.

    between ALL and DEBUG.  Modified Category class to add trace(..) methods
    like the existing debug(...) methods.  Modified LoggerTestCase and
    StressCategory tests to do a bit of TRACE-specific testing.
    
    Inspected but did not modify UGLI classes.  They don't include the FATAL
    level, so I didn't want to inculde TRACE level without further discussion
    which I will start on log4j-dev shortly.
    
    Ensured everything compiles.  Ran unit tests: the relevant unit tests
    pass.  Both the ""regression"" and ""runAll"" targets fail on a size-based
    rolling policy test, which was also failing before I made my modifications
    and anyways doesn't touch Level-related stuff, so I don't think it's
    related.
    
    There will probably be an additional coding pass in this area (if not
    multiple) to further integrate TRACE, modify JavaDocs, modify tests, etc.

    - improved level inequality rule logic to trigger an illegalargumentexception if an unknown level is passed in

        suppressed by default.  They can be enabled by explicitly setting the
        log4j.coreDebug system property.
    
      - The log4j.debug system property no longer has any affect as all
        log4j output is done through regular Logger objects. However, in
        configuration file in properties format, the log4j.debug property will
        cause PropertyConfigurator to *temporarily* output logs generated
        during the configuration process. This is very similar to the way the
        debug attribute works in configuration files in XML format.

       name. The public access categoryName field should not be accessed
       directly. Similarly, added the getLevel method which is now the

     - Log4j now will check if a system property called ""log4j.ignoreTCL""
       is set. If it is it will ignore the Thread Context ClassLoader when

Note that the default value depends on the JVM that is running Ant. In particular, if you use JDK 1.4+ the generated classes will not be usable for a 1.1 Java VM unless you explicitly set this attribute to the value 1.1 (which is the default value for JDK 1.1 to 1.3). We highly recommend to always specify this attribute.""

    to not need to reference chainsaw at all.
    
    Note: I've explicity added the ListModelAppender into the log4j core via this change, while
    this is an Appender that Chainsaw uses (and maybe it won't forever), it is a generally useful feature outside the scope of Chainsaw.   I'm happy to move this into the Chainsaw module if
    no-one thinks it's of much use in the core.

    Note that this fix introduces usage of the log4j.debug system property again.
    While we want to stay away from this system property, I'm not sure a better
    solution can be had since this initial debug information happens prior
    to Logger setup.  If an alternative solution is found without using this
    system property, I'd be all for replacing my fix with the better one.

    This is some what inline with what is already in trunk(1.3),
    which has already dropped the exception, but because there were
    other changes to the internal LogLog->Logger infrastructure change
    that allowed an ERROR level internal event to be generated,

    where threads are based on Socket management, the port # being managed is included
    in the name.  This follows a convention seen in many other packages (such as Tomcat)
    to easily identify the resource the Thread is controlling.
    
    I have renamed the AsyncAppender thread name that was already given an explicit name
    to follow the above convention.

    to facilitate removal of this temporary property when the marker is un-set for a loggingevent

    To enable ZeroConf advertising of an appender or receiver, a user can now:
     - add jmdns jar to their classpath
     - set the 'advertiseViaMulticastDNS' param to 'true'
    
    Also added support for discovery of appenders in Chainsaw (Chainsaw will automatically configure a matching receiver when connected).
    Supported appenders:
        SocketAppender
        SocketHubAppender (ZeroConfSocketHubAppender is still functional)
        UDPAppender
        MulticastAppender
    Supported receivers:
        SocketReceiver
        SocketHubReceiver (also receives events from ZeroConfSocketHubAppender)
        XMLSocketReceiver (can receive events sent over TCP by other logging frameworks)
        UDPReceiver
        MulticastReceiver
    
    Implementation details:
     - removed Zeroconf4log4j class, jmdns access is now through the ZeroConfSupport class (class provides support of JmDNS and ServiceInfo creation via reflection, and supports both jmdns 1.0 and jmdns 3.1 apis)
     - ZeroConfSupport class is now used by ZeroConfSocketHubAppender, Chainsaw and all appenders & receivers that can advertise their configuration via ZeroConf
     - added new 'advertiseViaMulticastDNS' param to the appenders and receivers that support ZeroConf
     - updated the ZeroConf site documentation
     - updated release notes
     - updated the ZeroConfPlugin html file
     - tested appenders with 1.0 and 3.1 jmdns jars
     - updated log4j references in poms to log4j 1.2.16-snapshot where necessary
    
    For those wanting to add ZeroConf support to third-party appenders and have Chainsaw discover the appenders, the service info naming convention is described here: https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48907

     - added java.net repository information to automatically provide javamail maven dependency (java.net repo provide javamail 1.4.3, so all javamail refs were updated to 1.4.3)
     - added openejb maven dependency information to support javaee class dependencies
     - updated 'version' property to 1.2.16
