    from a programmers and a users point of view.
    
    The central reason is that the history slows down
    scrolling significantly, and the algorithm does
    not permit limiting the history size.
    
    There are minor flaws also related to indication
    of history termination in case of disk overrun.
    
    I schedule a rework of the history stuff to
    konsole2.

    Cause:
        Konsole leaves a border beyond the right of the last column,
        if the pointer is positioned there, the x position is one larger
        than the rightmost screen position, which gets wrapped to the next

    Fixed the key events not going through by:
    -  if ( parent ) parent->installEventFilter( this );
    +  qApp->installEventFilter( this );
    Hmm, this approach sucks though - if embedding 2 konsoles one never gets
    the keypresses.
    
    And fixed crash on keypress by initialising the keytrans stuff in
    konsole_part.C - looks like this could be better designed with the singleton
    pattern...
    Reminder: click on kdebase/konsole/src/sample.shell to test this.
    Now, how to integrate this better...

    others) was having with konsole not reading in the schema and size anymore?
    Well, this fixes it for me.
    
    The bizarre part is where the problem appears to be -- it just doesn't
    make any sense!
    
    With lots of debug statements, I found out that the 'config' object stopped
    reading in *any* values after the 'slotToggleToolBar()' call in
    'readProperties'.  That is, the config->readEntry calls would *always*
    return the default, ignoring the saved value.
    
    I traced into the slotToggleToolbar function and found that all I had
    to do was comment out the 'enableToolbar' function and everything worked
    perfectly!
    
    I don't get it at all!  The enableToolbar function has *nothing* to do
    with KConfig so how is it changing it all of a sudden :-(
    
    Anyway, I moved the code around in readProperties and it works now.  Very
    very very weird.

    *) With the above fix, konsole doesn't work very well, because it still sets
    ""TERM"" to xterm. So I added support for specifying the terminal emulation in
    the ""session type"" -> ""Linux Konsole"" now sets TERM to ""linux"".
    *) The ""session type"" can now also specify a key tabel -> ""Linux Konsole"" now
    specifies (*surprise*) ""linux console"".
    *) The key tabel is bound to the session (not sure if it was already), now
    the menu reflects correctly the actual active key tabel.
    *) The default key tabel is only changed when the _user_ selects another
    tabel from the menu, merily selecting a new ""Linux Konsole"" as new session,
    does not change the default key tabel. The default key tabel is used when a
    new ""Shell"" is chosen for a new session (or the ""New"" button in the session
    toolbar is selected)

    ""\E[F"" for End. Correct is IMHO ""\E[1~"" for Home and ""\E[4~"" for End.""
    *) With the above fix, konsole doesn't work very well, because it still sets
    ""TERM"" to xterm. So I added support for specifying the terminal emulation in
    the ""session type"" -> ""Linux Konsole"" now sets TERM to ""linux"".
    *) The ""session type"" can now also specify a key tabel -> ""Linux Konsole"" now
    specifies (*surprise*) ""linux console"".
    *) The key tabel is bound to the session (not sure if it was already), now
    the menu reflects correctly the actual active key tabel.
    *) The default key tabel is only changed when the _user_ selects another
    tabel from the menu, merily selecting a new ""Linux Konsole"" as new session,
    does not change the default key tabel. The default key tabel is used when a
    new ""Shell"" is chosen for a new session (or the ""New"" button in the session
    toolbar is selected)
    *) the ""TERM"" setting as set by konsole and the actual key tabel in use is
    saved and restored during session managment. (BR18341)

    just install the two new schemes (Transparent.scheme and GreenTint.scheme)
    and select them.
    It works for gradient, tiled and centred backgrounds
    
    TODO:Just have to fix the rest of the ""tiled"" modes (except tiled itself)
    You can define new tints with the transparency setting in the schema file,
    just have a look at the examples.
    
    Konsole now generates the background and keeps a cache while it's in the same
    desktop. I've had to change it to be a KWMModuleApplication and connect
    a few signals for resizes and desktop changes.
    
    I've tried to design it so that it's easy to change if we ever make kbgndwm

    with the transparent terminals when launched from kdeinit
    (the transparent background disappeared when opening the
    second term).
    
    I think that both of these problems are due to the recent
    change from KTMainWindow to KMainWindow.
    
    Resize: before, the resize of the central widget was
    reflected in the size of the main window. This is not
    the case any more. This was useful because allowed us
    to resize the internal widget accurately which is
    important if you want to have for example 24 x 80.
    
    I have changed it such that now I am resizing the
    external window and try to calculate the size - I am
    taking into account the toolbar visibility and position,
    menubar visibility etc - but then there are other
    problems at startup when the toolbar is not visible etc.
    
    These calculations should be done in the libs not in
    the app. Maybe we can revert some of the functionality
    in the old ktmainwindow?
    
    Again, the background: krootpixmap installs an event
    filter to capture the repaint. To my best knowledge, these
    events do not go there if konsole is launched from kdeinit
    but they go if it launched from elsewere.
    
    I am 100% sure of this. (I reported this before). And it
    is a relatively recent phenomena (several weeks old).
    
    For the time being, I solved the problem by manually
    sending a repaint event. It works, but it makes a
    flicker when changing terminals.

    by the add-bookmark action) works only when the menu remains unshown. As
    soon as you show it, kbookmarkmenu refills the menu and therefore
    re-creates the action object, causing the accel to get installed again.
    At the same time I noticed that similar functionality for disabling the
    accelerator exists already, via KonsoleBookmarkHandler::setAddEnabled.
    Too bad that it doesn't work, though ;) . It just calls setAccel()
    on the menu, but that's not very effective, as the item was inserted
    by an action, which has a KAccel object behind, which additionally
    listens for AccelAvailable events. So I removed my code from yesterday,
    moved the code from setAddEnabled to the caller method in the konsole
    class (bookmarks_menu_check) and made it operate on the action. That's
    also the reason for the move to the other class: The action is owned
    by the konsole class, so code operating on that object belongs there,
    as it's accessible from there. There's one bug left though: KAction doesn't
    update the menu item's accel properly, in updateShortcut. Will fix that
    now. Sorry for the long log :)

    In the past, destroying a konsole part always resulted in a SIGKILL being sent
    to the child process (usually a shell). This in turn could have negative effects
    such as preventing the shell from writing its history file. This situation was
    very painful for users of QuadKonsole.
    
    Now a SIGHUP is sent first. We wait up to 1 second for the process to terminate
    before sending a SIGKILL. The method is copied from the non-part konsole.cpp.

      removing the need for a special color scheme to have a

    - Do not automatically reset the search start line on search hits
        This was causing the annoying behavior that if you were to pause while typing
        in a search term, and it would actually find a hit, then you would be searching
        for the term a second time once you finish typing.
    
        This commit introduces two new behaviors:
        1. When you show the search bar, all searching will be done from the first
            visible line in the terminal.
        2. This start position is only reset when you
            advance to the next result, by pressing ""next"", ""previous"", or the shortcuts
            RETURN or SHIFT-RETURN
    
    - When the view scrolls to a result, it will appear centered.
    - When showing the search bar, do not invoke a search, only apply the highlight filters
    - Add ""search from beginning/end"" button
        This will scroll to the top/bottom before searching
        Ctrl+return is also bound to this action
    - Text highlighted by mouse will be set as the current search text when the incremental
        search bar is opened
    - Add ""Search backwards"" to search bar options
        Button text is swapped according to reverse search switch

    \e[201~. This is mainly for text editors to temporarily switch off
    autoindent and line wrapping.

    New User-Visible Features:
        * 'Merge Windows' feature.  This merges all of the existing Konsole windows into a single
          window.  (The opposite of detach view in a sense).  Only merges the views from the active
          tab widget in each window at the moment.
        * Split-view feature.  Splits existing view top/bottom.
    
    New Front-end Progress:
        * Make creating a new tab and window work in the new front-end
        * Add detach-view in new front-end
        * Added ViewManager class which manges views and view containers in a main window as well
          as creating new views and session controllers for terminal sessions.
        * Added SessionController class which provides the actions associated with an individual session and view.
          (including the Edit and History menus)
        * Menu items now working: Copy,Paste,Clear,Clear & Reset,Clear History,Configure Konsole
        * Wrote a widget for incremental searches in documents ( IncrementalSearchBar ).  The widget
          is closely modelled on the incremental search bar found in Firefox.
        * SessionList class to provide the actions used to create new sessions in menus
    
    Fixes:
        * Fix crashes with multiple views caused by trying to change the size of the
          terminal image ( via setSize() ) after the user manually resizes the display
        * Update terminal size associated with pty when resizing display
        * Fix broken signal-slot connection in TabbedViewContainer
        * Check for a minimum terminal size of 1 line x 1 column when updating the terminal image
        * Ensure that internal array used by display widget to store terminal characters is always non-zero
          in size.  Also ensure that 'lines' and 'columns' internal properties are always > 0.
          Fixes crashes when display widget has a very small height or width.
        * Fixed crash with small display widget caused by TEWidget's count of used lines and used columns
          (usedLines,usedColumn fields) not being updated when the terminal image was made smaller.
    
    Refactoring:
        * Further file renaming for consistancy between file name and class name
        * Make ViewContainer subclasses take a QObject* parent argument in their constructors

      XMLGUI thingie.
    * Call 'close()' rather than 'deleteLater()' on main window when last session is closed,
      makes Konsole app close when last session finishes.
    * Added ViewProperties class from which SessionController inherits.  The ViewContainer has
      a ViewProperties instance associated with each view, which it uses to determine the title
      and icon associated with that view.  Icons and session titles now show in the tabs.
    * Added ""Monitor for Activity"" and ""Monitor for Silence"" in the new front-end.
    * Set value of TERM variable before creating session in SessionManager, fixes lots of problems
      with Linux Console session type.
    * Add a few CMakeLists.txt files from the new other/ directories to SVN which I forgot in the
      previous commit.

    * Initial draft of dialogs to manage sessions
        - SessionTypeDialog lists available session types and allows the
          user to trigger creation, editing or removal of a type.
        - EditSessionDialog allows the user to edit an individual session
          type.
    * Remove access to the old KDE 3 preferences dialog
    * Began a re-write of the Konsole part, the intention is to avoid
      the duplication of code between the part and the main application
      which occurred in KDE 3 and also to make more of the functionality
      from the main application available to the part's clients.
    * Implement the history size dialog
    * Implement SSH bookmarks
    * Implement Bookmark Tabs as Folders
    * Allow the user to choose which sessions are shown in the 'File' menu
    * Implement 'background mode'.  When Konsole is started in this mode
      (by running ""konsole --background-mode"") it creates a new session in the
      background which can be displayed or hidden at any time by pressing F12.
      Idea taken from Yakuake.
    * Use tab bar rather than a tab widget for the view container by default,
      removes the frame around the terminal display, this does not look correct
      if you are using the ported-from-3.5 KDE ""Plastik"" style in KDE 4.
      Qt's very-similar-looking Platique style produces the desired results.
    * Fixed two spectacular memory leaks.
    * Add option to split the view left/right ( in addition to top/bottom ) and
      allow more than two views open at once.  Dividing the view into a grid
      ( aka. ""recursive splitting"" ) is not yet supported.
    * Add menu options to Close Active View and Close Others ( which closes
      all views except the active one )
    
    // Behind the scenes stuff
    
    * Rewrote color scheme code
        ColorSchema -> ColorScheme
        ColorSchemaList -> replaced with global ColorSchemeManager
        KDE 4 INI-format color schemes are used if available with fallback to the KDE 3
        .schema files otherwise.
        * Some more Qt 3 -> 4 porting:
        Q3TextEdit -> QTextEdit
        Q3IntDict<V> -> QHash<int,V>
        Q3PtrList<T> -> QList<T*>
    * Various adjustments to resource loading so that the various
      *Manager classes can find their resources when being used in
      an application other than Konsole ( eg. when being used in a part )
    * Change access to singleton managers, the *Manager classes
      now have an instance() method to access the global instance and
      a setInstance() method which is called by the Application or KPart
      constructor to create the manager initially.
    * Remove all references to MainWindow from the ViewManager and move
      the relevant code to the MainWindow class itself.

    * Fix selection of color schemes and key bindings not being

      (eg. due to adding a new color scheme or editing an existing one).
    
      This also fixes the preview not being updated when mousing outside
      the list after adding a new color scheme.
    
      -> After updates to the color scheme / key bindings list the model
         was being deleted and a new model was created.  This caused the
         selection model to be changed without the signal-slot connections
         from the selection model to the dialog being re-established.
    
         This commit changes that so that the model is not replaced but
         simply cleared when the color scheme / key binding list is updated.
    
    * Disable the Edit, Remove buttons on the Appearance and
      Key Bindings tabs when there is no selection.
    * Fix crash when clicking 'New' button on the Appearance tab
      if the color scheme list is empty.

      to a color scheme which was based on the default fallback color scheme.

    Date:   Sat Mar 22 20:01:25 2008 +0000
    
        Make SessionManager::addProfile() public.  Call it automatically in SessionManager::setFavorite() if the profile is not already known to the manager.  When a profile is deleted via SessionManager::deleteProfile() mark it as hidden so that it is not recreated on disk if later changed.  Add debugging in ~Profile to track deletion of profiles.

        Compute the line index of a match found during output search more accurately.  Add a method to record the positions of new lines within the output stream to TerminalCharacterDecoder and use that in SearchHistoryTask to count the number of lines offset from the start of the current block.  Unlike the previous method this works when there are wrapped lines in the output.

    Please don't do huge sweeping changes of KAboutData things without talking to the authors first.  I'm sure they don't appreciate having their names removed from the about dialogs.
    
    Note that
    (a) the unicode copyright character is no more enforcible than (c)
    (b) while ""the KDE developers"" is not a legal entity, neither is ""Dolphin authors""
    (c) it was decided a while back that we don't care about whether the copyrights in about dialogs are meaningful, since they can't hope to encompass everyone who holds copyrights on the application code or any of the libraries it is linked to; the copyright headers in the source files are the important ones.

    implement their own BiDi algorithm. There is also another reason: comatibility. All terminals are *not* aware of the BiDi issue and do not re-order the chars
    (gnome-terminal, xterm, konsole, etc). It is possible to enable the BiDi rendering on each profile, so this is not a huge lost. I am still missing the keyboard shortcut to
    quickly enable/disable it (alt+control+b in konsole3), but I am not sure what is the best way for doing it.
    
    A quick note about the implementation:
    In QPainter3, there was an option to draw a text and tell the painter ""please do not implement BiDi"". In QPainter4 (up to 4.4) there is no such option. I am forcing it by
    drawing  ""painter.drawText(rect,0,QChar(0x202D)+text)"" (that is &LRO;), and it does seem to work, but I find it kinda ""hackish"". I will open a task in Trolltech and
    request that new feature. Hopefully by Qt4.5/KDE4.2 I will be able to change the implementation.

    The problem is that ViewContainer is a QObject and is not aware that one of its QWidget member can die because the ViewContainer is not part of the ""GUI"" hierarchy. So when you delete the main window it will first delete all QWidgets and then all QObjects, so in our case all GUI objects and then ViewContainer. But since ViewContainer react to destroyed signal of some GUI object and use it that explain the crash. Having QPointer is the easy to way to be aware if one of the member die because the GUI has been deleted.

    Move code responsible for 'forgetting' a view outside of code responding to the
    TerminalDisplay deletion.
    
    This avoids a loop like this:
    
    ~MainWindow
    => ~QStackedWidget
    => ~TerminalDisplay
    => QObject::destroyed
    => ViewContainer::viewDestroyed
    => ViewContainer::removeViewWidget
       - internal cleanup
       - try to remove TerminalDisplay from QStackedWidget which is being deleted and
    crash
    
    Instead the code now does:
    
    ~MainWindow
    => ~QStackedWidget
    => ~TerminalDisplay
    => QObject::destroyed
    => ViewContainer::viewDestroyed
    => ViewContainer::forgetView (does the internal clean up)
    
    And if one tries to explicitly remove a view, sequence is:
    
    ViewContainer::removeView
    => ViewContainer::forgetView
    => ViewContainer::removeViewWidget
    
    The patch also removes ViewManager::focusActiveView() because it causes a crash
    when closing a TerminalDisplay as it tries to put the focus on the deleted
    TerminalDisplay. I initially called it through a queued connection, but realized
    it is actually not needed for focus to be passed to the correct view, so just
    removed it.

      - the change is not saved into profile and only influences current tab
      - remove the 'Save to current profile' checkbox
      - remove the 'Defaults' button
      - change dialog title from ""Scrollback Options"" to ""Adjust Scrollback""
      - change action from ""Scrollback Options..."" to ""Adjust Scrollback...""
    
    The new dialog makes the ""Adjust Scrollback..."" action more consistent with most
    of other actions in the context menu, since they only influence or work in the
    context of current tab.
    
    The UI change is not quite satisfactory. Feel free to refine the UI part
    to make it more clear and elegant.

    This means running ""konsole"" literally in a terminal will open a konsole

    other emulators.
    
    Another befinit is it is now easier to use konsole for the ""Open

    Note: due to the ""single process"" model of konsole, konsole sometimes
    does not open the expected the direcotory when used by this ""Open

    - Do not automatically reset the search start line on search hits
        This was causing the annoying behavior that if you were to pause while typing
        in a search term, and it would actually find a hit, then you would be searching
        for the term a second time once you finish typing.
    
        This commit introduces two new behaviors:
        1. When you show the search bar, all searching will be done from the first
            visible line in the terminal.
        2. This start position is only reset when you
            advance to the next result, by pressing ""next"", ""previous"", or the shortcuts
            RETURN or SHIFT-RETURN
    
    - When the view scrolls to a result, it will appear centered.
    - When showing the search bar, do not invoke a search, only apply the highlight filters
    - Add ""search from beginning/end"" button
        This will scroll to the top/bottom before searching
        Ctrl+return is also bound to this action
    - Text highlighted by mouse will be set as the current search text when the incremental
        search bar is opened
    - Add ""Search backwards"" to search bar options
        Button text is swapped according to reverse search switch

    When setting a font for the terminal, if it is not found properly by the
    system, Qt attempts to use another font which is not an exact match. It
    happens that the other font is not fixed-pitch, so konsole ends up using
    an unsupported variable-pitch font for the terminal.
    
    Place a warning when an exact match for the desired font has not been
    found.
