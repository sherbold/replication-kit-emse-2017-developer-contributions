    This script can be executed by a developer to download and graft
    on the old EGit history, from before we moved the project to the
    eclipse.org namespace and the Eclipse Foundation servers.
    
    Executing this script is only necessary if you need to run log or
    blame past the migration boundary, and isn't always recommended when
    it comes to pushing objects to a remote server.  As mentioned in the
    script, it is best to use a specialized repository with this graft,
    not your main work repository.

    With large repositories it is difficult to get a subset of projects
    because the import projects tree could not be filtered. Now the
    import projects uses a filtered tree which is commonly used inside
    Eclipse.
    
    - The tree can be filtered with *text like syntax.
    - If a project is selected it always stays in the view even if it
      does not match the filter.
    - If projects are deselected with the ""deselect all"" button they can
      be removed from the view if it does not match the filter string.
      This is done by calling setinput again. This is not done for
      individual deselections because that did not look right and I am
      not sure about the setinput overhead on really large repositories
    
    I have tested this with the following repositories:
    git://github.com/smilebase/org.eclipse.mylyn.github.git
    git://github.com/aptana/studio.git
    git://ecf1.osuosl.org/home/gitcvs
    and the egit and jgit repositories
    
    It was noticed that some of the aptana and ecf projects (notably the
    feature projects) were not attached to teaming after import. This is
    probably not caused by this change.

    The view creates a regular TreeViewer using the basic constructor
    that does not specify a style bit. Internally, the JFace code
    will create a new SWT Tree widget using SWT.BORDER. This introduces
    an unnecessary border around the tree which takes away precious
    pixels from the user interface.

    The view's code was arbitrarily introducing a TreeColumn to the
    view's tree which had a width of 700. This meant that when the
    view's width became less than 700, it would have to show scroll
    bars to accomodate for this. However, it should actually only be
    showing scroll bars if it has to and not because of some arbitrary
    value has been surpassed.
    
    The worst part is that using columns means that the text can only
    go as far as what is dictated by its width. Since the view does not
    have any column headers displayed, the user actually has no way of
    resizing the column to view all of the content. The fix is to just
    not use any columns and to let the tree itself determine whether it
    needs to show scroll bars or not based on whether it is currently
    displaying content that exceeds its own width.

    Replace IWorkspaceRunnable in EGit operations (e.g. BranchOperation)
    by a new interface IEGitOperation.
    IWorkspaceRunnable is no good interface for an operation. The user
    thinks he has to execute the operation using Workspace.run. But that
    is not right for all EGit operations. Currently many operations are
    used by just calling op.run. Thus a new interface with an execute
    method was introduced. Those operations that need a workspace runnable
    and a scheduling rule do the workspace runnable in their execute
    method (e.g. branch). It's an internal of an operation how it needs
    to execute.
    BranchOperation now uses a workspace runnable to lock the workspace
    while the working tree is modified.
    BranchAction executes BranchOperation in a Job. The other actions
    will be adopted to this execution pattern in further commits.

    JGit will report a new repository state MERGING_RESOLVED. Currently EGit
    doesn't support committing in this state. Missing is the correct handling
    of the content of .git/MERGE_MESSAGE and .git/MERGE_HEAD. When committing
    in this state these contents have to be used and after a successful commit
    these files have to be deleted.
    
    This fix adds a special check for this new state and disallows committing
    in this state.
    
    This change depends on JGit change I0a885e2fe8c85049fb23722351ab89cf2c81a431.
    This change will break the build of EGit if this JGit change is not merged.
    On the other hand: As soon as the JGit change has been merged we'll have to
    merge this change soon.

    The compare request does not currently check whether a file is in
    the index before displaying the compare editor. This causes
    problems when the editor tries to ask the revision for its content
    and JGit is unable to return something meaningful here because a
    blob cannot actually be found. The fix is to check if an entry
    actually exists in the index before trying to create a compare

    When editors are asked to be opened in the Eclipse workbench, the
    default behaviour is to simply activate an existing editor if an
    existing editor shares the input with the input that is to be
    opened. The contract for comparing editor inputs is via the
    equals(Object) method. For a FileRevisionEditorInput, this
    is implemented by checking the equality between the two inputs'
    underlying file revisions. As such, CommitFileRevision should
    implement equals(Object) (and hashCode() for consistency) so that
    the same editor can be reused instead of having multiple editors
    open on a given revision.

    This occurs because these menu actions are implemented

    To reproduce, open a Git History, then open ""History"" on some non-

    Operations performing a work dir checkout (e.g. branch, reset) may delete

    related bug.
    
    This fix deletes projects that got inconsistent by the work dir checkout.

    BranchOperation was added.
    
    Also TagOperation doesn't need to refresh projects since it doesn't modify

    Furthermore, no suitable error message is shown when this value

    The fix makes the startup failsafe by logging an error if the config

    With the advent of merge capabilities, we should
    make the repository state (mostly merge, rebase)
     visible in the Git label decorationsfor projects.
    Instead of adding another tag, we re-use the
    ""repository name"" tag and append the repository state separated by
    a pipe similar to the behavior in msysgit.
    This allows to elegantly treat the ""SAFE"" state that we don't
    want to show explicitly: we just add nothing to the repository name.
    This avoids ugly formatting issues which we would run into
    if using a separate tag: unless we would want to always show
    the state (even if it is SAFE) we would introduce ugly spaces
    into the label decoration in case the state is SAFE (and thus the
    displayed value is null or an empty String). The alternative of howing
    the state always does not appear to be the right thing, either, as it
    would pollute the label decoration with un-needed information in the
    99 percent case.

    The bug describes a specific problem which was occurring
    in different wizards due to their implemenation using
    some event mechanism to notify the ""next"" wizard page
    of URI changes. This has been removed and the ""next""
    wizard page is notified about the URI by overriding the
    setVisible() method and setting the current URI just
    before the page opens.
    This pattern has been applied for all affected pages.
    It also helps in decoupling the different wizard
    pages by removing hard-coded usages between them.
    As for the specific bug, we may need some other
    improvements depending on whether URI validation on
    the RepositorySelectionPage is needed. This could for
    example be added as a 'Validate URI' button or such.

    Introduced getShell on RepositoryViewCommandHandler to easily retrvieve the active Shell.
    This is used in almost all commands and we can get rid of the getView().getSite().getShell() chain.
    In addition, the RepositoryViewCommandHandler now uses HandlerUtil to obtain the context variables
    and propagates possible exceptions to the callers.

    While writing tests for EGit Core, the following problems with
    PushOperation were identified:
    1. an operation result is returned even if the operation was not run before
    2. when re-using he specification used to create the operation, the
    operation result is completely wrong (says UP_TO_DATE and does
    not update the remote repo even if it should)
    These issues were fixed and corresponding tests
    were added.
    
    Other tests for the
    
    1. ListRemoteOperation
    2. TagOperation
    3. TrackOperation
    4. UntrackOperation
    5. DiscardChangesOperation
    
    were added along with some infrastructure for these
    tests (which need to set up two repositories instead of just
    one).
    
    There were also some intermittent failures to delete resources
    in GitResourceVariant* and BlotStorage tests. Hopfully the change there
    will improve this.
    
    Total test coverage for egit core improves from around 34
    percent to around 51 percent.

    In the TrackUntrackOperation test, apparently, the check whether a file is ""tracked"" was too

    Some UI tests were broken because their sequence has changed and thus some
    user preferences that were changed no longer have their default values as
    expected by some other tests.
    
    Furthermore, the ""delay"" being set by a static method in one of the test
    base classes got lost due to this change (whether this parameter is effective
    depends on the sequence of class loading, so it is not reliable), and the
    delay was removed altogether and some Thread.sleep() calls or local refresh
    calls were added where needed. This resulted in much faster execution.
    
    In order to allow delayed replay, a specific launch config was checked in.
    Finally, one test was broken to to productive code changes.

    Bug: 306459
    Bug: 314096
    
    We should not use the (internal anyway) class TeamAction in order to
    implement our actions. We still have to contribute Actions as
    Object contributions in the action framework so that they
    appear in the Team context menu, but we should
    put the implementing code into command handlers
    which can then be re-used, for example between the team context
    menu actions and the command contributions used in the
    Git Repository view. The actions are just lightweight objects that
    delegate their run() method to the command.
    
    In addition, this is a prerequisite for adding key bindings (it
    is possible to add a command id to the contributed actions using the
    ""definition id"" feature of the corresponding extension point; the
    key binding (if found) defined for that command will then automaticall
    be displayed in the context menu).
    
    This only the first step which splits the current actions contributed
    to the team menu into a lightweight action part and a command handler part
    which is doing the actual work. The next step would be to weed out
    the double implementations in the Git Repositories view and either use
    the handler defined here or use a second set of handlers and make use
    of the ""enabledWhen"" feature of the ""handler"" extension point to enable
    the correct handler depending on the workbench selection.
    
    In a future step, key bindings could be added to the commands.

    With the advent of http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,735,
    one of the GitCloneWizard tests fails if a ""replay delay"" is used,
    since the ""fix"" branch of the test repository alone is cloning too fast for the
    SWT Bot to capture the window that is displayed during clone.
    On the conrary, without a delay, one of the Git Repositories View
    tests fails when checking for the label decorations after check-out.
    
    With these fixes, both the delayed and the undelayed launch
    configurations should work for running AllTests (the memory

    to accommodate the Synchronize tests).

      and cause an OutOfMemoryError.
    
    * Adapted to the new style RepositoryListener interfaces, which
      promises better long-term API stability.

    The generic Show In > History context menu is not shown in all perspectives and the
    perspective extension point used to contribute to is must be implemented
    for each and every perspective declaratively, so depending on the perspective
    the menu items contributed by us will not be available.

    We should consider to change Compare With > History in such a way as to
    display a ""History dialog"" (with content similar to the history view) to select a
    version which is probably closer to what an end user would expect (at the moment
    this is rather the same as Show In > History / Team > Show History).
    
    The changes in the action handlers were needed because it turned
    out that the previous implementation results in a stack overflow when
    the ""definitionId"" property of the popup menu extension point is used. This
    property is in turn needed to prepare the team context menu for displaying
    the keyboard shortcuts to be added soon.

    This introduces the OSGI 3.5 trace infrastructure and replaces the
    current minimal implementation with the proper one which
    provides powerful features (automatic addition of method names,
    thread name, line numbers and so on).
    The next steps will be to instrument our coding and to provide
    a UI for dynamically setting the debug options during runtime
    and to add some tests.

    This change is intended as first step to imporove the usabily of the
    Git History View. From the end user perspective, the following changes
    are noticeable:
    
    1. there is a new toolbar button ""Show all versions for the resource""
    which makes the ""resource mode"" explicit (in other words, we now have
    four radio buttons insted of three where selection of no button at all
    would represent the fourth option)
    2. ""Wrap comments"" and ""Fill paragraphs"" is only available when the context menu
    is opened on the comment viewer
    3. The file-specific menu entries (compare, open) were promoted to the top of the context
    menu if a file is selected
    
    Internally, all the ""popupMenu"" contributions were removed and replaced
    with command contributions and the corresponding actions were refactored out
    of the GitHistoryView class into handlers in order to improve maintainability.

    just to fix the compile errors, but we should come back and change

    only be closed if the save completes successfully.

    It appears that commit ""Fix NPE while opening CompareView for oldest
    commit"" with was fixing bug 322732 was only
    workaround. In previous implementation of
    GitModelRepository.getChildrenImpl() we were using LogCommand to
    calculate complete list of commits between to given points.
    LogCommand.addRange(AnyObjectId, AnyObjectId) internally calls
    RevWalk.markUnimportant(RevCommit) on first given AnyObjectId to
    addRange() method. RevWalk implementation disposes commits that was
    marked as unimportant when traversal has finish. Because we were joining
    results of two LogCommands (since common ancestor to destination and
    since ancestor to source) the common ancestor commit was included in
    commits list but it was disposed by RevWalk, therefore we got an NPE
    while launching Compare view. Current implementation of
    GitModelRepository.getChildrenImpl() uses single RevWalk instance and
    don't mark any commit as unimportant therefore it is free from NPE in
    CommitFileRevision.

    Similar to the package explorer which supports flat vs. hierarchical
    package representation, this allows to toggle between flat vs. hierarchical
    branch representation. If the toggle is on, then the ""/"" used in the
    branch names is interpreted as hierarchy separator and the branches are
    presented correspondingly.
    Other than the suggestion in bug 315567, this does not eliminate the
    ""Remote Branches"" node altogether in ""hierarchical"" mode, since
    there might be remote branches without ""/"" separators
    which would result in a confusing representation.

    The behavior of the history view is quite confusing for most users:
    instead of showing the current input, a combination of input and
    the currently checked button is displayed above the list. Not only
    do the users have a hard time to understand what they are seeing
    and why they have certain context menus available at a given time,
    but also when the ""Repository"" button is selected, the repository name
    is always shown as input, no matter where you click. Subsequently,
    the navigation history will contain the same String several times, and
    you don't see what you have in fact visited.
    This change does replace the current String with something
    like ""File: MyProject/folder/File.txt [myRepository]"", or
    ""Project: MyProject [myRepository]"" etc.
    
    The getDescription() method was also changed to return something
    like the above appended with a description of the current ""filter"" setting,
    for example ""All changes in Repository of this Resource"" or ""All changes
    of this Resource"", but unfortunately, this information is never rendered
    (the javadoc says it might be rendered as tooltip or such)... I opened

    The main reason of not displaying synchronization data for two remote
    branches was that GitResourceVariantTreeComparator was using standard
    SyncInfo class which uses local file to determine change kind.
    
    The new GitSyncInfo is looking for a first diff for given file in given
    range of commits. Based on this it determines change kind and
    direction.
    
    Git specific SyncInfo is activated only when the user doesn't select
    ""include locally changed files"" in synchronization dialog. When this
    option is selected standard implementation of SyncInfo will be used.
    
    Additionally ""Workspace"" model is only enabled when ""include locally
    changed files"" option is selected, in other case this model will be
    excluded.

    Initially we always refreshed when the repository changed, but users
    were not happy, so we tied it to the workspace refresh option. This ment
    Eclipse performed unnecessary work by scanning resources twice. Both
    an infrequent periodical scan and a triggered scan.
    
    Now we only scan for index changes since a ref change by itself does
    not hint that a resource has changed. In addition the default is to
    only scan for repository changes and refresh resources when Eclipse
    has an active workbench window, which means that you can perform Git
    operations outside of Eclipse with no (or at least less) interaction
    between Eclipse and C Git. This used to be a big problem for Windows
    users performing rebase operations, because Eclipse locked files for
    brief periods preventing C Git from updating them.

    conflicting changes, i.e. changes that cannot be auto-merged.

    In case of nested projects AdaptableFileTreeIterator finds
    more than one container for a given file. The old implementation just
    took the first found container. This could cause problems if the
    container is not accessible (project closed). The new implementation
    does the following:
    1. Non accessible containers are excluded
    2. The remaining containers are checked if they reside in a project
    shared with Git. The first matching container is chosen.
    Furthermore container lookup was improved. In the past the
    IndexDiff of CommitActionHandler always started with an
    AdaptableFileTreeIterator. This was not correct if the Git repository root
    was an Eclipse project and caused the problem that derived files in the
    project folder were shown in the Commit dialog.

    This is a first implementation of Rebase. Users can select a branch in
    the Repositories View and have a menu item ""Rebase"". The currently
    checked out branch will be rebased onto the selected branch.
    If no branch is currently checked out, the menu action will not be
    available.
    
    In case of merge conflicts, the rebase will be aborted, i.e. the
    original HEAD will be restored and the user will receive an error
    pop-up. This is because we found several problems if the repository is
    left in state ""merging:
    1. It is not possible to resolve the conflicts using ""add"", so the
    user can not continue with the rebase (in the command line), no matter
    whether they ""add"" in EGit or in the command line.
    2. There are some issues when ""aborting"" with the command line a
    rebase that was started with EGit: HEAD is restored to the
    wrong branch (i.e. the target branch)
    
    These issues will be fixed in subsequent changes.

    When a file has the flag ""assume-unchanged"" it should per default not

    In native git commit -a does not commit such files, commit -- <path>
    however does. The pre-selection in the commit dialog contains the list
    of files which are committed with commit -a, filtered by the selection
    in the Package Explorer. Therefore the file with the flag

    However the metadata directory could be contained by the working

    The commit operation as used from the commit dialog did not delete
    trees when they became empty. Today Git does not leave empty trees,
    it is not intended here and the user certainly does not expect it.
    
    We also add a testcase for this, though the tests for the CommitOperation
    lack a lot in general as the logic is not tested anywhere else. Moving
    to DirCache will probably reduce the number of needed tests at this
    place.

    When creating a new branch based on a remote branch, we suggest

    to facilitate this, we select the name in the Text control so that the
    first keystroke replaces it completely.
    
    Not suggesting any name in this case is probably not as good as the
    user might start to type in the same name as would have been suggested
    just to find out that the branch already exists.

    With this change a simple caching mechanism for resource decorations
    is introduced that is based on two timestamps: one timestamp is
    resource-specific and the other one is valid for the entire
    workspace.
    
    There are mainly two types of events that GitLightWeightDecorator
    handles: on the one hand IResourceChangeEvent, an event that only
    affects a dedicated set of resources, and on the other hand various
    events that are related to the connected Git repository.
    
    The Git repository events are generic and thus result in firing a
    LabelProviderChangedEvent that is handled by views showing decorated
    content (e.g. package explorer). Before firing this event the
    timestamp on workspace-level now is updated to indicate that all
    cached decorations (with a lower timestamp) are invalid.
    
    When handling an IResourceChangeEvent the resource-specific timestamp
    is cleared. This means that the cached decoration for this specific
    resource is no longer valid. Afterwards the same generic
    LabelProviderChangedEvent is fired instead of an event for the
    dedicated set of changed resources. This allows every view to
    decide what to update instead of forcing an update of invisible
    resources as well - which was the case before. This leads to more
    re-decorations, but due to the fact that for all unchanged resources
    cached information is available, this is very fast and in the end
    avoids unnecessary decorations of invisible resources - as mentioned
    above.

    When comparing DirCacheEntries to ResourceEntries it is checked
    whether they differ with regards to modification timestamp and file
    length. Whereas the timestamp is available for all IResources and thus
    cached by Eclipse, the file length needed to be retrieved from the
    actual file on disk for every comparison.
    
    With this change a session resource property is introduced that stores
    the file length once it has been retrieved from disk. The property is
    removed whenever a resource changes (by eventing).
    
    Using persistent properties for this scenario first seemed to be an
    even better idea, but as these properties are stored on disk by
    Eclipse there was a huge performance degradation when filling the
    cache, i.e. during the first traversal of a TreeWalk containing a
    ContainerTreeIterator (e.g. after startup of Eclipse).
    
    So with this change there is no improvement for the performance of
    decorating a project for the first time after Eclipse starts up, but
    every refresh on project level as well as all decorations of (deep)
    folder structures are significantly improved. Furthermore the
    ContainerTreeIterator is also used in other use cases, i.e. when
    opening the commit dialog.
    
    See bug 325393 for performance results.

    A new pair of ""Push to upstream""/""Fetch from upstream"" menu actions is
    added to the team menu as well as the Repositories View. When clicked,
    the relevant remote is detected (either upstream configuration of the
    currently checked out branch, or ""origin""), and the push/fetch is
    tried for this configuration if possible.
    
    If the currently checked out local branch is configured to use ""."" as
    upstream (i.e. the local Repository, because the branch is based on
    another local branch), the actions are disabled.
    In any case, after the fetch/push, the user can click ""Configure...""
    on the push/fetch result dialog in order to inspect or change the
    configuration.
    
    Alternatively, the user can use the new ""Configure Fetch from
    Upstream..."" and ""Configure Push to Upstream..."" menu items in the new
    ""Remote"" sub-menu available in the Team context menu to do the
    upstream configuration.
    Also, the ""Fetch from..."" and ""Push..."" actions (with the advanced
    wizard) were moved to that new sub-menu to reduce the size of the Team
    menu.
    
    When configuring the Push, there is a small wizard that allows to
    easily select the correct branches etc. For the Fetch case, there is
    currently only a rather technical dialog, which should be replaced by
    some wizard asking questions like ""Do you use Gerrit to push to"" in
    order to let the user make the right decisions.

    The RepositoriesView looks up the RepositoryCache with all the
    directories it ""knows"". When an Exception occurs, it is logged, but
    the corrupt Repository is not removed from the view. When the view is
    refreshed or re-initialized, the Exception is logged again.
    
    The Exception described in the bug occurs if the config file does not
    contain an entry
    
    core.repositoryformatversion = 0
    
    which is checked in the constructor of FileRepository. The check was
    introduced to ensure interoperability with the command line Git.
    
    With this fix, the Exception is only logged once and the offending
    Repository is removed from the Repositories View.

    When HEAD and index contained a regular file (a file with the
    executable bit not set) and in the working tree the associated
    file was modified to be an executable file then EGit had a bug
    while committing this mode change. In EGits commit operation
    the index was updated and the tree for the commit got prepared.
    The index was updated correctly but the tree to be commited
    always contained a regular file. After the Commit operation
    we had different entries for this file in index and HEAD.
    
    This commit fixes this by explicitly checking for executable-bit
    in the associated index-entry and setting the new TreeEntry
    accordingly.

    This improves the performance of the CommitMessageViewer by
    only rendering the commit message and other meta information by
    default. The diffs for the files in the commit are not rendered
    immediately when clicking on a commit, but only when the user selects
    files in the file list.
    
    This results in dramatic performance improvements if there are commits
    containing many files.
    
    The user can still click ""select all"" in the file list to get all the
    diffs into the view.
    
    In addition, the diffs are rendered asynchronously letting the user
    cancel the operation when it takes too long.
    
    Some tracing was added to help maintenance in the future.

    This limits the number of commits to show in the history page to ten

    The second thing is to hide the ""tag sequence"" by default. This is

    When HEAD and index contained a regular file (a file with the

    be an executable file then EGit had a bug while committing this mode
    change. In EGits commit operation the index was updated and the tree
    for
    the commit got prepared. The index was updated correctly but the tree
    to
    be commited always contained a regular file. After the Commit
    operation
    we had different entries for this file in index and HEAD.
    
    This commit fixes this by explicitly checking for executable-bit in
    the
    associated index-entry and setting the new TreeEntry accordingly.

    GitChangeSetSorterTest is fully independent from Eclipse RCP therefore
    it can be launched as pure JUnit4 test case.
    
    MockRevCommit class is added to be able to set commit time without
    setting up a full git repository, therefore
    GitChangeSetSorter.shouldOrderCommitsByCommitDate() will fail with
    ClassNotFoundException when this tests is launched as a plug-in test.
    
    Adds proper configurations for launching JUnit tests from maven build.

    When a resource changes there are several events fired that lead
    towards re-decoration of this resource (and parent resources). These
    events are often redundant, e.g. when checking out a different
    branch, JGit fires a RefsChangedEvent and an IndexChangedEvent.
    Furthermore Eclipse detects that a resource changed and thus fires a
    ResourceChangeEvent. But in the end only one re-decoration should be
    triggered, thus a mechanism is introduced that delays firing an event
    for 100ms and ignores further events within this time frame.

    When having multiple projects (each corresponding to a different
    repository) and needing to regularly keep up to date with changes, EGit
    provides no easy way to deal with this. The only way at the moment is to
    select a single project and pull, and repeat that for every project.
    When the number of projects is two, this is okay, but for more than a
    couple of projects it's simply infeasible.
    
    This change enables pull for multiple repositories. The UI still has to
    be improved in a subsequent change, as it currently shows one result
    dialog per repository. It has to be changed so that only one result
    dialog is shown, see bug 340780 for that.

    really right here, as a Ref should point to a valid object id, and the
    ids aren't generally known before a clone. This lead users of
    CloneOperation to passing a Ref with only a name set, and no object id
    (using a anonymous Ref subclass or passing null as object id).
    
    Before the parameter was a Ref, it already was a String, but one could
    only specify a short branch name (e.g. ""master""), not a full ref name
    (""refs/heads/master""). With this change, it's still the full ref name,
    just as a String.

    According to discussion we had in bug 326767 I've decided to activate
    Workspace model by default instead of Git Change Set model.
    
    This commit also fixes an issue in
    GitResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.members method which was causing
    misleading results in Workspace model.
    
    Additionally this change includes also UI tests cases for both
    Workspace and Git Change Set models. Common parts were moved into
    AbstractSynchronizeViewTest.

    This exposes static methods to create the BranchOperationUI instead of
    specific constructors which should make usage for the consumers
    easier.
    
    Both BranchOperation and BranchOperationUI take String as argument
    which is to be used for Ref name and Commit ID as well (JGit takes
    care of the rest).

    This adds some dialogs to be used for checkout and deletion of
    branches which are used in the Team->Switch To...->New branch... and
    Team->Switch To...->Other... Menu actions.
    
    New Branch... will first call a dialog to select the base (branch,
    tag, Reference) and then start the usual wizard with the selected base
    as parameter.
    
    Other... will open a dialog to select a branch, tag, or Reference for
    checking out. Upon ""Ok"", the Ref is checked out.
    
    With this, users can use specific, simplified UIs for the very common
    operations of branch creation and checkout instead of having to use
    the generic BranchSelectionDialog which offers too many actions.

    Previous implementation was creating four times a small window with

    When viewing the diff (from the commit dialog) of a file that has a
    different encoding than the workspace encoding, it contains incorrect
    changes.
    
    One way to reproduce this problem:
    
    - Set the Eclipse workspace encoding to ISO-8859-1.
    - Create an XML file that has an explicit UTF-8 encoding set (either
      through an encoding attribute in the XML or as an explicit property on
      the resource). Add some non-ASCII characters in the file.
    - Commit it.
    - Change some unrelated lines in the file.
    - Open the commit dialog.
    - View the diff of the file.
    
    Before this change, the diff would show changes in the lines with
    non-ASCII characters, even though they didn't change. The reason is that
    the encoding of nextFile is correct because it is from the workspace.
    But it's wrong for baseFile because it's read as a blob from the repo,
    and the diff view therefore falls back to the wrong workspace encoding.
    
    After this change, the encoding from the IFile is also used to decode
    the previous file contents, and the diff is correct.

    Displaying diffs in the commit dialog for non workspace files needs to
    be implemented in a follow-up commit.

    Git's staging area is one of its most powerful features. This view
    provides users with the ability to drag-and-drop files between
    the working directory and index.  Such an operation would be
    synonymous to adding the modified files to the index and tracking
    the untracked files. Other operations like committing is also
    possible from the view's context menu.

    commit changed the behavior so that it opens a new top level window when
    you select the 'Compare with->HEAD Revision' menu.  It used to create a
    new editor.  This change in behavior is a regression since the top-level
    window is disruptive to a standard multi editor workspace.  It also
    means standard functions like search and editing are no longer
    available. Reverting this commit fixes this regression.

    This uses the Refactoring capabilities available in Eclipse to allow
    sharing an Eclipse project with a Repository that is not located in a
    parent folder of the project.
    
    By default, the Sharing Wizard now allows selection of an existing
    Repository (from the RepoView) and optionally a relative path
    within this repository into which the project is to be shared (always
    using the project name as terminating folder).
    
    Upon finish, the project location is then moved to the new target folder
    (a child folder of the working directory of the selected
    Repository) before the ConnectProviderOperation is executed.
    
    Users can click a checkbox to enable the previous behavior where the
    Repository can only be created in a parent folder of the selected
    project or projects.

    The comparator provides the means to sort a list of strings using a
    natural sort order (i.e. ""2"" before ""10""). It had two problems.
    
    The first one was that it could not handle strings that contained many
    numbers (when all the numbers concatenated exceeded Integer.MAX_VALUE).
    This lead to a NumberFormatException. Because the comparator is used in
    CreateBranchPage, it was impossible to create a branch in a repository
    that had a ref with such a name (e.g. stable-1-0-0_2011-05-25).
    
    The second one was that it resulted in the wrong order for some inputs.
    For example, the following inputs would not be sorted as listed here:
    
      project-1-0-0-final
      project-1-0-1-beta
    
    With the implementation of this change, it behaves correctly for these
    two problems.

    When looking at the history of a single resource in the History view and
    then opening a commit in the Commit Viewer, the Files section would show
    invalid changes.
    
    The problem was that the parent of the RevCommit was set to the previous
    commit for the same resource and therefore the diff included all changes
    between those commits (not only to the previous one).
    
    We fix this by re-parsing the commit with a clean RevWalk before showing
    it.

    to have its layout operations deferred, the layout data will not be

    This is based on the previous work by Mykola Nikishov in change
    I800dd9f23953ad903f20289c442707e2dde08f75 (""Import a project set file"").
    This change includes export support, unit tests, and can handle the
    situation where different branches of the same repository should be
    imported.
    
    A project reference string in the project set file looks like this:
    
      1.0,git://egit.eclipse.org/egit.git,master,org.eclipse.egit
    
    Based on an array of these reference strings, GitProjectSetCapability
    does the following when importing:
    
    - Clone a repository with CloneOperation for each combination of
      repository URL and branch name.
    - Import a project from each directory that is specified in the last
      part of the string (""."" if the repository itself is the .project).
    - Add the repository to the Repositories View.
    - Connect the projects using ConnectProviderOperation.
    
    Due to Bug 244313, import and export of project set files requires the
    org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in. The dependency is in a
    separate optional feature, as proposed on the old change. It's required
    for Eclipse < 3.7.

    The text merge viewers need to be notified when changes to a
    compare input are saved. The text viewer can be notified of
    changes from the diff node. Hence, when the compare input itself
    has been notified that its been changed, this change event must
    be forwarded to the diff node so that the text viewer can be
    updated and reflect the differences of the newly changed compare
    input.

    The search dialog table that shows the Git repositories was
    grabbing an excess amount of space causing the dialog to open
    larger than the screen height with no scrollbars on the table.
    This was apparent if you had ~50 repositories configured in the
    Git Repositories view.
    
    This was due to the fact that the SearchDialog class sets the
    layout data on the main control of the search page after it is
    created which overrides the locally set layout data.
    
    The fix prevents setting the layout data on the main control
    after it has already been set by using a simple subclass of
    Composite.

    When no code review has been done yet on the remote repository in Gerrit
    the fetch operation throws an exception when there is the refspec
    refs/notes/review:refs/notes/review. Since this is standard Git behavior
    to expect a ref on the remote if there is no wildcard in the refspec we
    do not add this refspec in this case.

    If a synchronization operation is only asking a specific set of
    resources to be updated, only that particular set of resources
    should be filtered out for an update of the synchronization
    cache. This removes the need to walk the entire tree when the
    user has only made changes to a small number of resources.

    potentially be an empty string if the project is both the parent
    of the .git folder as well as the selected root resource for the

    skip the discovered empty string and don't bother setting a

    We can now move and rename projects within a repository for a number
    of cases. Moving a project to a subdirectory does not work and since
    Eclipse actually destroys the project, we simply forbid it for now
    (Platform bug 307140). The bug is only worked around in Eclipse 3.7,
    i.e. forbidden in the UI.
    
    This also adds tests for move and delete of folders and files. We are
    quite inconsistent with respect to how we handle the index, i.e.
    sometime we update the index to reflect the change and sometimes we do
    not, so the current behavior may not be the final behavior.

    error-prone). With this change, the name is automatically suggested
    based on the remote name.
    
    So when ""refs/remotes/origin/stable-1.0"" is selected, we pre-fill the
    text with a suggestion of ""stable-1.0"", which is usually what is wanted

    We keep updating the suggested branch name in case the user chooses a
    different source ref, but stop doing that when the name is changed

    Currently the AddToIndexOperation provides the input resources as
    scheduling rule. This is wrong because this suggests that two Add To
    Index Jobs can run in parallel if the input resources are not
    conflicting and belong to the same Git repository.
    Now a scheduling rule is used that locks all projects of a given
    repository to prevent Jobs running in parallel that modify the index
    of the same repository.
    The scheduling rules of other EGit operations modifying the Git index
    were changed accordingly.

    e.g. if you fetch refs/changes/* from Gerrit, this translates

    In real that is ~3.3 seconds for a repo with the large number

    Take a simpler approach and scan every branch until we find the
    selected commit or one of it's parents. After this fix info update
    with the large refs set is about .5 seconds. For normal clones
    there is no difference.
    
    Furthe improvve by using the heuristic that says commit times should
    be increasing for each new commit and therefore do not examine branches
    whose tip commit is older than the commit we are lookig at. Allow for
    a clock skew of 24 hours. After this getBranches() is down to 0.35

    The branch status is shown after the branch name in the decoration if
    the current branch is different from the remote tracking branch. This is
    useful as a visual indication that the branch needs to be pushed (or
    merged/rebased).
    
    If there are commits on the branch that are not on the tracking branch,
    an upwards arrow (↑) followed by the number of commits is shown. This
    can be read as ""the branch is N commits ahead"" or ""N commits need to be
    pushed"".
    
    If there are commits on the tracking branch that are not on the local
    branch, a downwards arrow (↓) is shown, followed by the number of
    commits. This can be read as ""the branch is N commits behind"" or ""N
    commits need to be merged"".
    
    For example, if there are 2 unpushed commits on master, the project is
    now shown like this:
    
      project [repo master ↑2]
    
    If there are both unpushed and unmerged commits (the branches have
    diverged), it's shown like this:
    
      project [repo master ↑2 ↓1]
    
    In C Git, information about the tracking branch is displayed in ""git
    status"" output. EGit currently doesn't have any indication that a branch
    needs to be pushed, apart from the labels in History View. When there
    are multiple repositories involved, it can easily happen that a push is
    forgotten. This change helps to prevent that.
    
    This depends on JGit change I8d2b108c89905c3f0496f3d517879596740787c0.

    otherwise the result is directly evaluated.

    The RepositoryFinder.register(IContainer, File) method is capable of
    registering a repository with a path that is not relative to the
    containing project, because of the nature of File.getCanonicalFile().
    For instance, if you are working in /dev/workspace/project and that path
    contains a .git symlink which points to /dev/repo/project.git, then the
    registered path for that repository will be the latter.  However, code
    in RepositoringMapping.getGitDirAbsolutePath() and
    ExistingOrNewPage.fillTreeItemWithGitDirectory()
    make assumptions about it being relative to the containing project.
    
    This only occurs on Posix platforms because File.getCanonicalFile() does
    not have the same behavior on Windows.  Specifically it doesn't
    recognize junctions (the Windows equivalent to symbolic links) and
    therefore does not try to resolve them.
    
    This patch addresses the problem by removing the use of
    File.getCanonicalFile() and replacing it with File.getAbsoluteFile()
    which is already there as a fallback if File.getCanonicalFile() throws
    an exception.  This will make the behavior of sharing a project the same
    on both Windows and Posix platforms.

    The history view current displays a status message and hides
    the commit graph table when loading or showing no input.  This
    produces a flickering when switching between repositories or
    when in link with selection mode.
    
    Now the history view keeps the current table input while loading
    the new input in the background and shows an empty table when
    no commits are found to display.
    
    The status message during loading did not seem necessary since
    the job is present in the Progress view with information about
    what is being loaded.  Also an empty table seems sufficient to
    let the user know there are no commits to display.
    
    Also no longer join the job when canceling the refresh job
    since it can hang the UI thread.

    When comparing two commits via ""Compare with Each Other"" in History

    1. For CHANGE cases, the commit ID label and the actual content of the
       sides did not match. This is fixed by always showing compareRev on
       the left, consistent with setLeftLabel and setRightLabel earlier in
       the code.
    
    2. For ADDITION/DELETION cases, the icon shown in the tree was reversed.
       For an addition (file doesn't exist in base/right, exists in
       compare/left), a [-] was shown (weird). By ORing it with
       Differencer.RIGHT, we get a nice left to right arrow with a +/- in it
       (which is then correct).

    This reverts commit f95c105980fc8dc1c356665bb796f256d62bf1ca.
    
    The problem with the save action is that it also results in removed
    braces for the if in the following example:
    
      if (foo)
        try {
          bar();
        } finally {
          baz();
        }
    
    Which, altough it's a single statement, isn't recommended because it's
    longer than one line and confusing.
    
    See I1279030286ef177f3360ff70660a9365e4f3119a for the exact reasons.

    It sometimes happens that a user amends a commit that is already pushed.
    This leads to a rejected push when the user tries to push the next time.
    It happens either by accident or when the user doesn't yet know about
    how to use amend.
    
    To avoid this, a warning text is now shown when the user presses amend.
    It's only shown when the commit to amend is contained in any remote
    tracking branch (which means the commit is no longer just local).
    
    In the commit dialog, the warning is shown as a dialog message, the same
    way the existing warnings already are.

    also warnings about author and committer text, the same way as in the

    page does not update the Properties view.  This is because
    the config used by the preference page does not propagate the

    Previously a RenameCallback was registered on the FollowFilter
    to find the previous path of the file being compared.  This
    led to incorrect behavior since the callback fires for all
    renames, not just for the commits processed through directly
    calling RevWalk.next().
    
    Now a RenameDetector is directly used after computing the
    diffs between the head commit and the previous commit.
    The path is only updated if the rename detector detects
    that the current path was renamed between the two commits.

    Similar to the ""Fetch from Gerrit"" wizard, the user must select a URI

    IndexDiffCacheEntry.waitForWorkspaceLock is used to synchronize
    IndexDiff calculations with workspace changes. IndexDiff calculation is
    started when the workspace can be locked.
    
    The old implementation performed an empty Workspace.run to achieve this.
    This could result in the state that Workspace.run acquires scheduling
    rule workspace root and waits for OrderedLock because another thread is
    broadcasting changes.
    
    To avoid this blocking of workspace root waitForWorkspaceLock now avoids
    calling Workspace.run. Instead JobManager().beginRule is used to wait.

    the installation did not complete, e.g. on Eclipse 3.7.

    clear that this is an optional feature that is only needed by plugin

    This extends the hard wrapping of the commit message in the Staging View
    and Commit Dialog.
    
    With the previous behavior, if one had a finished line/paragraph and
    added text at the front, the text at the end would get
    wrapped
    like
    this.
    
    That made manual re-wrapping necessary. In the case of a paragraph,
    several lines had to be edited again.
    
    This change improves that use case by turning the line delimiter after a
    wrapped word into a space to join the lines. It takes care not to join
    empty lines or lines which start with a symbol (e.g. a bullet list).
    
    It also gets rid of flickering during wrapping by only redrawing after
    having applied all edits.

    JGit change I1333a8dd170bb0077f491962013485efb6f2a926 is about improving
    the ours/theirs conflict markers during rebase. The way the rebase
    action worked before, it would always pass the commit ID to rebase,
    which is not very helpful during a rebase conflict.
    
    This change makes it use a Ref if there is one. If there are multiple
    refs pointing to the selected commit:
    
    - and if the branch being rebased tracks another one, this tracked
      branch should be the one to pick if it's in the list
    - otherwise pick a remote tracking branch if it's in the list
    
    Also adds a ""does it work at all?"" test for rebase in History view.

    the default container/folder decoration. It also collects repository
    name and branch info to allow those decorations for working sets.

    The implementations of getMappingForNonWorkspaceResource() and

    paths with filesystem locations.
    
    The problem is that IResource#getFullPath() returns e.g. /foo/bar (where
    / means workspace root), whereas IResource#getLocation() returns the
    absolute file system path. This caused later code which treated the
    paths as absolute file system paths to return incorrect results.
    
    Instead of incorrectly using an IResource for non-workspace files, we
    now work with IPath if necessary, e.g. for comparing with index from
    Staging View.

    Filtered resources are useful when working with nested projects, like
    this:
    
      root/
        .project
        sub/
          .project
    
    In the above configuration, the root project typically contains resource
    filters so that ""sub"" is not shown as a subdirectory of root in
    navigator views but can be imported as a separate project.
    
    When resources are filtered, they are not returned from API like
    IContainer#members. So ContainerTreeIterator needs to check if resource
    filters are configured and if that's the case, list additional
    files/folders through the Java File API. It then falls back to
    AdaptableFileTreeIterator for subtrees.
    
    This depends on small changes in JGit's FileTreeIterator, see below.

    IWorkspaceRoot#getFileForLocation returns an IFile when asked with a
    folder location. This can later lead to problems because exists()
    returns false.
    
    By checking with exists(), ResourceUtil now correctly returns an
    IFolder. And it's now actually consistent with its own Javadoc.
    
    This is necessary for I7d986900e713b581b7baa19a8e850a5ee37585a7 to work
    with folders.

    The solution involves two parts. First, PushOperation did not consider

    Second, PushOperationUI used to take the passed RemoteRefUpdates and

    There were a few things contributing to the instability:
    
    - The test setup was only done once in @BeforeClass and then ""cleaned
      up"" by doing a reset twice and waiting. Setup is now done in @Before
      and a complete cleanup is done in @After, so that test execution order
      does not affect the outcome.
    
    - Switching between ""Git Commits"" and ""Workspace"" models was done by
      clicking on the drop down in the Synchronize view toolbar, which is
      very fragile. The desired model is now enabled via team API once for
      each test class.
    
    With this, 2 tests no longer need to be ignored and all tests succeed
    reliably on my machine.

    instead when no prior indexDiffData is available.
    
    This can happen because full reload jobs cancel each other, whereas an

    This provides a quick way to install the tools typically used by
    JGit/EGit contributors. In addition it provides an alternative to using
    a target platform for provisioning 3rd party dependencies required to
    compile and test JGit and EGit. Using a target platform is more accurate
    as it allows to separate the dependencies of the workbench used for
    development from the one used for testing. But using a target platform
    is typically slower since PDE tries to communicate with p2 repositories
    listed in the target platform.
    
    In order to install dependencies and plugins typically used by EGit
    developers click ""Import... > Install > Install Software Items from
    File"" and select this p2f file, then select the bundles you want to
    install and click OK.

    would have been allowed to provide comparison input. This is a
    limitation of the current synchronize model that happens when a file

    This commits works around the limitation by allowing the model compare
    adapter to be used when possible, i.e. a comparison with the local

    of only the direct children. So e.g. with changes in ""dir/a"", ""dir/b""
    and ""dir/c"", it returned a node for ""dir"" three times. When the number
    of changes is significant, this resulted in many children returned, each
    of which also has children which will be processed by the calling code.
    
    The code in GitModelCommit for tree construction did it right. To fix
    this, this change consolidates the two tree construction implementations
    into one which should be correct.
    
    It also takes care that the final tree nodes use as little memory as
    possible by using arrays.

    In a nested project layout, e.g.:

        sub/
          .project
          a.txt
    
    ""sub"" is not necessarily excluded from root with resource filters.
    
    So when calling ResourceUtil.getFileForLocation for a.txt,
    IWorkspaceRoot#getFileForLocation (before this change) would return an
    IFile belonging to the root project, even when it was closed. When the
    project is closed, IFile returns false from exists() and later results
    in the RepositoryMapping not being found.
    
    One way to fix this would be to only return the IFile if it exists(),
    and return null otherwise.
    
    But in the above case, we can return an IFile that exists, from the sub
    project. To find this, we call findFilesForLocationURI and then return
    the first file which exists.
    
    This fixes the reported problem while also including linked resources,
    which is desired in the future.

    This change improves that by rendering the files that are not matched by

    before. With this, the files can be found at a glance instead of reading
    through the paths.

    This changes all of the actions where comparing with a common ancestor
    makes sense :
    1. Compare With > Commit
    2. Compare With > Branch, Tag, Reference
    3. Double-click a commit in the history view
    4. Right-click a commit in the history view > Compare With Workspace
    5. Right-click a file in the history view > Compare With Workspace
    6. Right-click a file in the commit viewer > Compare With Workspace
    
    The only two actions that were previously ignoring common ancestors
    were the comparison with a branch tag or reference, and comparisons
    from history/commit viewer ""with the workspace"". All were modified
    in order to factorize common code as much as possible.
    
    Comparisons of files located out of the workspace (java.io.File) was
    not functional because of a regression in HistoryPageInput introduced
    by 5246f101fed6fe7541aa1ce8f9fec5b778beb788 that made the ""singleFile""
    input of the history view a Boolean instead of an actual File.
    Furthermore, comparing these ""local"" files, which can be done through
    actions numbered 3 to 6 above was incoherent : while 3 and 4 compared
    the HEAD revision, actions 5 and 6 compared the working directory,
    including local changes. All four now consistently take the local
    changes into account.

    During rebase, the rebase pulldown menu in the toolbar was always
    disabled, resulting in no way to do a ""abort"" or other actions through
    the toolbar.
    
    The problem is that the enabled state of the action handler for the main
    action also determines whether the pulldown menu can be opened (the
    little arrow besides the icon). So instead of disabling it when rebase
    is not possible, also enable it during rebase, and check state again
    when executing.
    
    In addition to the above, this fixes RebaseActionHandler's enabled state
    to behave the same way as RebaseCurrentRefCommand, in that it's also
    enabled with a detached HEAD.

    The logic in getMapping did not cover the case properly when a path was
    totally outside a repository mapping. For example, when workingTree is
    ""C:\my\working\tree"" and the path in question is ""D:\a\cloned\repo""
    path.makeRelative(workingTree) would return path ""D:\a\cloned\repo"".
    As a result, the if clause is true and the mapping is returned although
    the working tree from the mapping is completely unrelated to the path.
    
    A better (and simpler) way is to simply use workingTree.isPrefixOf(path)
    for the check. This properly determines if a path is within a working
    tree.
    
    The commit also adds a test for detecting the situation.

    Running the SWTBot test suite on a Windows environment highlights
    insidious file handle leaks caused by JGit's WindowCache which keeps
    "".pack"" files open for reading and thus locked for deletion until the
    repository is properly closed, but EGit might not keep a reference
    towards this repository in its cache, ""forgetting"" to close it when
    needed. This is mostly true for sub-modules.
    
    This patch also gets rid of other random errors, sometimes due to a
    .project not properly removed.

    Do not queue jobs unnecessarily and eliminate some unneeded jobs. As it
    turns out, this is mostly a cosmetic problem.
    
    The jobs have a potentially long initialization where they just lessen
    the risk of executing in parallel with other heavy jobs. During this
    period we may still cancel previous jobs just to queue a new one,
    getting a huge queue of jobs. For the full re-indexing jobs, we can just
    ignore re-indexing since the first one will do all necessary work.
    
    Also acknowledge the fact the full re-indexing job does all work that an
    incremental indexing job does and therefore we can skip launching an
    incremental indexing job if a full reindexing operation is imminent (in
    locking phase).
    
    Finally reduce the total number of re-indexing jobs for all repositories
    to two. Two or three seems to be a general practical limit for how many
    jobs can be run in parallel without losing performance due to trashing.

    user expects the full history of the target resource to be returned,
    except if the SINGLE_REVISION or SINGLE_LINE_OF_DESCENT flags are
    positioned.
    
    The SINGLE_REVISION flag is properly handled, however when no flags are
    set, EGit previously returned only the commits descending from HEAD,
    without considering the history that exists on other branches or
    references.
    
    This adds specific tests to make sure of the behavior when either no
    flag or the SINGLE_REVISION flag are set.
    
    The history's ""getTarget"" and ""getContributors"" were rewritten to allow
    for some of Team quirks: when using the synchronize view, Team will use
    its own file revisions instead of what was originally fed to it. We thus
    need to adapt those revisions to types known to us. A specific test
    demonstrating this use case has been added.

    The fix provides stronger checks on selected linked resources before
    enabling menu items. In particular, linked resources that point to a
    file that is part of a project shared with egit are allowed to be
    operated on. Otherwise team actions are disabled if the selection
    contains a linked resource pointing to a file outside any project and
    repository. A default isEnabled() implementation is provided for this
    behavior. After adding a test case a couple more handlers have been
    amended and made compliant.

    Since Gerrit 2.3 the path segment /p is not needed anymore when
    accessing Gerrit with the http protocol [1].
    
    This patch was initially created because there was a bug in Gerrit when
    pushing with /p [2], which has been fixed in the meantime. When testing
    the change, bug 407984 was detected.
    
    The logic to add /p is removed from the Gerrit Configuration wizard in
    order to fix bug 407984, avoid unnecessary complexity and because
    Gerrit 2.3 is deprecated since a long time: 2.3 was released in April
    2012, the latest release is 2.5.4 and 2.6 will be released soon.

    The ""merge"" key in a branch section of .git/config describes the name of

    ""refs/heads/master"", not ""refs/remotes/origin/master"".

    just showed all refs, making it likely for users to configure the wrong

    It now calculates the refs based on the value of the remote entry, by
    mapping remote tracking refs back to how they are called on the remote
    (according to the fetch specs) and only showing the matching refs.
    
    Because the values in the branch combo now depend on the values in the
    remote combo, show the remote combo first (for a clear flow).

    In NavigatorDragAdapter, used by the Navigator view, dragFinished
    deletes the dragged resources when the operation was DND.DROP_MOVE.
    
    This resulted in the dragged files being deleted when dropping onto the
    ""Unstaged Changes"" or ""Staged Changes"" in the Staging view.
    
    This was the case even before bug 385412 introduced the possibility to
    stage via drag and drop from Package Explorer.
    
    The reason that this bug didn't occur with the Package Explorer is
    because it doesn't delete files after DND.DROP_MOVE (which seems like a
    more sane behavior).

    ""Gerrit Configuration..."" on a remote node in the repo view is the only
    Gerrit menu that's shown when a repo is not configured for Gerrit.
    
    To test whether Gerrit is configured, the following is used:
    
    * Is ""gerrit.createchangeid"" set to true in Git config?
    * Are there any remotes with a push refspec where the destination starts
      with ""refs/for/""?

    See bug for how to reproduce. The fix consists of two parts:
    
    1. Change isVisible to getVisible.
    
    For isVisible to be true, the parents of also have to be visible. In the
    case of the warning label, we also want to correctly toggle it even if
    e.g. the staging view is not currently visible.
    
    2. Rework modify handlers
    
    Instead of requiring users of CommitMessageComponent to handle modify
    events of author/committer texts themselves, handle it in the component.
    The advantage of this is that the message does not have to be updated
    when the listeners in the component are disabled. Before this, a warning
    would theoretically be shown for a brief moment when authorText.setText
    was called inside updateUI but the committer was not yet set.
    
    The first part alone would have been enough to fix the problem. The
    second part improves the code by making it simpler.

    It was not clear how to order menu entries defined via the deprecated

    So they are now defined using the non-deprecated org.eclipse.ui.menus.
    
    To not duplicate visibleWhen expressions, they are defined via
    org.eclipse.core.expressions.definitions, which enables reuse.

    local branch based on it.
    
    This change shows a question whether to create a new local branch or
    whether to check out the commit behind the remote-tracking branch.
    
    To make it clear that there will be a question, the label is
    ""Checkout..."" instead of ""Checkout"" when a remote-tracking branch is
    selected.
    
    For advanced users already knowing about this, the question dialog is
    not shown when the warning about ""detached HEAD"" is disabled.

    As a default, I think having the tree expanded makes more sense than
    collapsed, so that the files can be seen instead of just some parent
    folders. Using the compact tree, I caught myself always pressing ""Expand
    All"" as the first step after starting Eclipse, and I've seen other
    people being bothered by having to expand the nodes (I don't know why
    they didn't use the ""Expand All"" button though).
    
    In the list view, we were always showing all files, so performance
    should not be a problem. And as soon as the user collapses a node, ""auto
    expand"" is disabled as implemented in an earlier change.
    
    In the future, we could also consider persisting the state.

    With certain workflows (non-Gerrit), creating a branch and pushing it to
    a remote (including setup of branch tracking) is a common operation.
    Currently, this is pretty complicated with EGit and a source of errors,
    bug reports and help requests.
    
    This change tries to provide a solution for the following use cases:
    
    * The user created a new repository and wants to push it for the first
      time (probably one branch and no remotes yet).
    
    * The user created a new feature/release branch and wants to push it to
      a remote, and set up tracking in the same step (git push -u).
    
    It adds an additional wizard for both the above cases. For the toolbar
    push action, the wizard is started when no upstream branch is configured
    yet.
    
    It's also available in the Team menu and the context menu of the
    repositories view (on repo and on individual branches).

    the option ""Display Latest Branch Commit"" being enabled, the tag was
    parsed a third time.
    
    With this change, each tag is parsed only once in the content provider
    and the result is stored in the TagNode. Also, it uses one RevWalk
    instance instead of N.

    The most common cause of unstable UI tests was that the test data
    (repositories and projects) was set up once per class, and then each
    test method used the same data. When one test method only reads the data
    but another modifies it, the test may fail depending on the order of
    execution.
    
    This is an attempt to fix this by changing the test setup so that it's
    done once per test method (@Before instead of @BeforeClass). To make it
    easier (and possibly faster) to clean up and reduce the possibility of
    accidentally sharing the data, the data for each test method is created
    in a separate directory.

    When a remote repository could not be reached there was a dialog which
    only described some of the possible scenarios. Moreover, it always
    proposed to look at the ssh preferences, even if ssh was not used.
    
    We now give more explanation about possible failures. Possible errors
    in case of ssh or https are only shown when these protocols are used.
    
    The Exception was not logged, this is fixed now as well.
    
    In further change we could also react on the concrete type of the
    Exception thrown inside JGit. E.g., an
    org.eclipse.jgit.errors.NoRemoteRepositoryException would indicate that
    there is no network problem but a wrong repository path.

    In contrast when the rebase command is returning after initialization

    edited using Repository.writeRebaseTodoFile(). The interactive rebase
    has then to be invoked with PROCESS_STEPS in order to start processing.
    Note that the method RebaseInteractiveHandler.prepareSteps() will be
    called anyway just before starting to process the rebase todo file.

    A diff to each parent (normally just one) is shown. Only the hunk
    concerning the current line is used to keep the diff small. This helps
    in understanding what the blamed commit changed in the current line.
    
    The text above the diff shows the parent commit ID and includes a link
    to show the annotations of this parent commit. When clicked, a new
    editor is opened for showing annotations for that commit. It also jumps
    to the correct line.
    
    Together, this enables quickly going through the history of a file and
    inspect the changes that happened over time.

    Before, the commit that was shown was the blamed commit from the cursor
    position, which could be confusing to the user.
    
    To solve this, two things needed to be changed:
    
    The first time a selection changed event happens for the revision
    selection provider, we ignore it as it is for the ""initial"" selection.
    The confusing thing about this is that the user has not yet consciously
    selected a revision. To fix this, we now always ignore the very first
    selection.
    
    When opening an editor with annotation for a start commit (e.g. for the
    show annotations link in a hover), we now show this commit in the
    history view.

    When the staging view is shown after startup and it's still
    initializing, the rebase buttons were shown for a time, and then hidden
    after initialization was finished.
    
    The reason was that updateRebaseButtonVisibility schedules the hiding
    using Display#asyncExec. When called from createPartControl, this is not
    necessary, so hide it directly there.

    When switching from a repo that is in the normal state to one that has
    conflicts, a warning for ""invalid committer"" was briefly shown and then
    hidden again, causing some flickering.
    
    The reason was that the text fields are set to """" in case of conflicts,
    which triggered the warning, only to be removed again later. So make
    sure that setting to """" is done at the end and also don't cause any
    ""statusUpdated"" events when the fields are not enabled.

    combo is ineffective (e.g. no filtering). Apart from that, it slows down
    the dialog even when the user does not intend to change the source
    branch.
    
    This changes it to a ""Select..."" button which shows a branch selection
    dialog where the user can filter.
    
    To clean up the appearance, an icon is shown for the source branch
    representing the type and the short branch/tag name is used (that's the
    name the user sees everywhere else).

    The submodule Git directory is in .git/modules/$mod and the .git in the
    submodule directory is a text file with ""gitdir: ../.git/modules/$mod"".
    
    This change includes three parts:
    
    * Use FileRepositoryBuilder in RepositoryFinder to find repos, because
      it already knows how to handle the above format
    * Fix GitProjectData to handle RepositoryMapping where getGitDirPath
      returns an absolute path (IPath#append just ignores that)
    * Fix ExistingOrNewPage to be able to handle absolute paths where the
      Git directory is not below the worktree path
    
    FileRepositoryBuilder from JGit does not try to find a repository inside
    GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES (like C Git does, see [1]), whereas EGit did
    include the ceiling directories themselves. This change in behavior
    required adjusting the test setup to set the ceiling to the parent dir.

    The GenerateHistoryJob was scheduled over and over when the following
    precondiations were met:
    
     - The preference ""Team > Git > History > Maximum number of commits to
       show"" has to be set to a numer smaller than the number of commits
       in a repository
     - The history of the repository is fully loaded into the History view
     - The user scrolls down to the end or
     - The user selects a reference which is not yet loaded into the
       History view
    
    Scrolling triggers the event listener added in the constructor of
    CommitGraphTable (This is done to implement incremental loading).
    The event listener calls the method loadItem of GitHistory Page to load
    a given commit specified by its index. This method asks the
    GenerateHistoryJob if the commit is less than BATCH_SIZE / 2 away from
    the end, and if so, triggers a new GenerateHistoryJob.
    
    After loading the commits the GenerateHistoryJob wrongly computed the
    value of the incomplete variable. It did not check if all commits of
    the history were loaded. Because of that the updateUI method did render
    the UI again leading to another call of the event listener above.
    
    This commit adds a check if all commits are loaded.
    This is unfortunately not easily done with the SWTCommitList.
    
    So we check if no new commits were loaded in the current invocation of
    the GenerateHistoryJob and in that case step out of the loop before
    the check for incomplete is done. Then the method updateUI in
    GenerateHistoryJob will not render the UI again and not start the
    endless loop anymore.
    
    But the updateUI method has to render the UI once more after all
    commits are loaded. This is ensured by the new field
    forcedRedrawsAfterListIsCompleted.
    
    The case that a certain commit should be selected but is not found is
    handled differently. The UI is not drawn again, but the incomplete
    warning is updated.

    WorkbenchTreeContentProvider had a serious problem in that it only
    descended into folders which existed in the workspace. The reason for
    that was that it used getChildren of its base class
    WorkbenchContentProvider.
    
    For example, when the base (workspace) version had these files:
    
      a
      b/1
    
    And compare version (e.g. Git Index) had these:
    
      a
      b/1
      c/1
    
    The ""c/1"" file should be shown as ""deleted"" in the view. The problem was
    that the ""c"" folder was not contained in the workspace and so the
    content provider never included ""c/1"". It did include deleted files
    whose parent folder was known, but not others.
    
    This could maybe have been fixed by introducing artificial folder nodes
    (implementing IWorkbenchAdapter) in such a situation (but only for the
    special case above).
    
    Instead, this change unifies the workbench with the PathNode content
    provider code. Care was taken to keep the appearance by using
    WorkbenchLabelProvider for container nodes and continuing to work with
    IFile where possible. The tree construction was also simplified.

    seconds to 500-800 ms.
    
    Maybe getting the resources could be made faster by not using
    findFilesForLocationURI/findContainersForLocationURI, but instead going
    through the projects of the repository and using getFile/getFolder and
    only falling back to the above in case nothing is found.

    When doing a pull, commit or other operations that change refs, existing
    GitDocuments are reloaded. GitDocument is used for Quick Diff, which is
    active when the user uses Quick Diff, or when ""Show Annotations"" was
    called.
    
    Doing this possibly expensive operation (it can involve rename
    detection) on the UI thread blocks the UI, so do it in a background job
    instead. Note that RemoteRevisionQuickDiffProvider (for CVS) of
    eclipse.platform.team does it the same way.

    How to reproduce:
    
    1. Add a few lines in the middle of a tracked file
    2. Save the file
    3. Execute ""Show Annotations""
    
    Expected: The annotations for the lines below the added ones should be
    correct.
    Actual: They are at the wrong location (too far down)
    
    The problem is that BlameCommand also reads the local file content when
    startCommit is not set. But in Eclipse, local changes are already
    handled by the Quick Diff provider. So before, they were accounted for
    twice. By only blaming HEAD, the Quick Diff logic can work correctly.

    In English, there seems to be a subtle difference in the meaning of ""can
    not"" and ""cannot"", where ""cannot"" indicates an absolute impossibility,
    while ""can not <verb>"" implies the possibility of actively chosing not
    to do <verb>. In EGit we therefore always want to use the ""cannot""
    variant in all comments and user interface texts.

    When viewing a repository in the Staging View for the first time after
    starting Eclipse, the IndexDiff data for this repository is usually not
    available yet. During StagingView.reload(), first the stored Staging
    View state is restored. Then enableCommitWidgets(false) is called,
    which disables everything, and worse, also clears the just restored
    inputs, including the commit message.
    
    When the IndexDiff for the repository becomes available, reload() will
    be called again.
    This change postpones restoring the view state to that time. This way
    the restored commit (and amend etc.) state remains intact. With the
    IndexDiff available, the inputs will not be cleared after restoring them
    (unless there are conflicts to be resolved).
    
    This change prepares for commit message restore after restarting
    Eclipse.

    On certain cumbersome platforms (looking at you, Windows), a branch
    switch may fail when something is running that uses the files. In case
    of launch configurations inside Eclipse, we can detect that and warn the
    user about it.
    
    We could even offer to terminate it, but as termination may be async, we
    just offer continue/cancel. The user can also choose to not show any
    warnings again.
    
    The code for detecting this searches the ISourceContainer of the
    launches to see if one is for a project of the repository. This works
    e.g. for ""Java Application"" run configurations and also for servers
    (WST). I first tried ILaunchConfiguration#getMappedResources, but it
    does not return anything for servers. Maybe there is an easier way, but
    I couldn't find it.
    
    See bug for how to test this with servers.

    For detecting whether a fetch is possible, just check if any of the data
    has a dstRemoteName.
    
    Because dstRemoteName was also set for HEAD and local branches (which
    does not make much sense), GitSynchronizeData was adapted to only set
    them in case of remote-tracking branches. The logic was also improved to
    check the remote configs instead of just pattern matching.
    
    I noticed that GitSynchronizeData's getSrcMerge was only used in tests
    and getSrcRemoteName only used in PushAction. But there, isEnabled was
    testing dstRemoteName, while runPushOperation was using srcRemoteName.
    But dstRemoteName makes more sense, as it is used together with
    getDstMerge. So, this change also removes the two unused fields,
    including associated logic.

    Before, all projects were connected to the repository that was
    cloned/selected. In case of projects that are inside submodules, this
    would connect them to the super repository.
    
    With this change, the repository is searched again (in parents) to find
    the right one. If they are not within a submodule, the finder will
    automatically find the original repo.

    The commit dialog already worked, so I don't see a reason why the

    The NPE occluded the actual exception of bug 434343.

    This modifies the Cherry Pick menu item in the History view such that
    multiple selected commits may be cherry-picked at once, instead of
    one-by-one.
    
    Cherry-picking now uses the mechanics of interactive rebase. If a
    conflict occurs during merging one of the commits, it needs to be
    resolved manually, and then the interactive rebase may be resumed
    (just like with a regular interactive rebase.)
    
    Cherry-picking a single commit uses the same mechanics just mentioned.

    IWorkspaceRoot.findContainersForLocationURI(URI) method performs very

    The fix tries first to get the direct workspace resources map hit by

    fails, fail over to the slow findContainersForLocationURI method.
    
    This works very fast for almost all cases (constant execution time) and
    adds only a small overhead if the matching project/folder is contained
    in a *closed* project which overlaps location of another *opened*
    project.

    The IndexDiffCacheEntry currently immediately schedules update jobs on
    resource changes. Given a resource related task which affects multiple
    resources in 'n' workspace changes (e.g. ""clean compile"" on n projects),
    IndexDiffCacheEntry.scheduleUpdateJob() is called n times on same
    repository, creating n jobs (which in worst case creates n threads in
    Eclipse), running one after each other and creating n notifications on
    completion. This significantly affects Eclipse UI performance on huge
    git repositories.
    
    To avoid this, one single (collecting resources) IndexDiffUpdateJob is
    created and used per IndexDiffCacheEntry. On each resource change
    pending changes are collected by this job, but instead of immediate
    scheduling default delay of 400 milliseconds is used to schedule the
    job. This reduces both memory consumption and overhead by reducing
    notifications count to UI listeners.

    In case the upstream branch is local, it makes more sense to suggest the
    name of the branch itself.

    I don't know why, but the setMessage(null) call caused the dialog size
    to be smaller than its contents. Change it so that the initial message
    stays, which looks nicer. Also, don't show an initial empty name as an
    error, which was the case when creating a branch for a commit from the
    history view.
    
    In case of creating a new branch from a commit and then choosing another
    source in the dialog, resize the dialog to fit its contents.

    Several History view actions currently fail when the view is
    set to follow renames since they derive the path used from
    the current repository path and do not take into account
    older paths that the resource was known as.
    
    This commit creates a simple RenameTracker class that tracks
    which commits introduced renames allowing the GitHistoryPage
    to provide the previous paths for a specific commit given the
    initial path.
    
    At the moment, rename tracking only works when ""Show all changes of
    selected resource and its children"" is checked, because JGit currently
    does not allow combining a FollowFilter with e.g. a PathFilter.
    
    The commit also makes the commit viewer's ""Compare with Previous
    Version"" honour renames.
    
    Caveat: This change unfortunately undoes some of the work in
    I4ae8abfc4dbe7ed772749afa80743278247585ee and my manual test coverage is
    pretty low (IFile and IResource only)
