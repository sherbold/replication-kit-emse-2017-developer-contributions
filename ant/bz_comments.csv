Patched WixTask java source file

When customizing the wix ui library, lit.exe instead of light.exe are used to produce a wix library instead of a msi binary. for example:

candle.exe MyWixUI_InstallDir.wxs ....
lit.exe -out MyWixUI_InstallDir.wixlib MyWixUI_InstallDir.wixobj ...

lit is almost same as light except it used to produce library, not msi final binary.

There is no need to write a task for lit only since very likely it used in same way as light, so here is the proposal to have a lit attribute in wix task, by default it is false, means light.exe will be invoked, when set to true, it will invoke lit instead.

&lt;dn:wix target=&quot;MyWixUI_InstallDir.wixlib&quot;

2) Preference Manager - Allows the creation of editors for preferences for 
each module if desired.

3) New property editor - The new property editor is created by Introspecting 
the selected task creating
appropriate field for the getter/setter bean property.  Since Ant tends to not 
have getters a middle
piece was created to port the setters to properties thus giving read/write 
capability to an otherwise
write only property.

4) New visual look for the editors - Follows a lot like the eclipse editor for 
their xml pieces (I don't
know how better to explain it, it's a must see addition).

5) Property Helper - Much like a code completion piece in an IDE except this 
only helps with the property
selection.  If a user types a $ and then nothing for predetermined time up 
pops a property chooser with 
a list of already defined properties.

6) Source Viewer - Shows the document that is being created.  No editing 
capability.  Color coding
(preference editor does not currently work).

With the plainListener I can see the output from the tests after all the tests are run.  This change makes it possible for the person running the tests from the command line to see the output of the tests *while they are running*.  As you can see from the patch, it writes log messages from the test to the verbose level, so you would only see this output if you add the -verbose option to the command line.  (In practice, it would be better to allow some other command line option to specify whether AntUnit writes the log messages from the tests to the Ant log (not on verbose level) because adding the -verbose option always add so much other stuff to the log.)","(In reply to comment #7)

C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;C:\bea\jdk142_08\bin;

I suppose the problem is in C:\bea\weblogic81\server\lib\weblogic.jar because
if this line take out of the classpath then ant working without problems.(
i have tried also to put this string to the beginning of classpath but still
without any positive effect)
But i still can not get the logic why ant behaive like that or what should
i do to use my C:\bea\weblogic81\server\lib\weblogic.jar line in classpath and
still running c:\ant\ant.bat
I will really appricate if you could get me a little hint or explain the nature
of this problem.

You used to get Xerces as your default SAX parser factory while you now have

written it yourself) really only works when Xerces is used you have to make
sure it either explicitly asks for it or Xerces will be used by the JDK.  The
former can be done by using SAXParserFactory#newInstance with two
argiments and the later by using the endorsed standards override

I just try to build it again in the morning, it's somehow works ! I can't understand &amp; I can't explain why. the code is completely the same as last week, I have do nothing in the weekend, I just leave it on there and spend my weekend as usual. it's so weird :(

I also removed &quot;/bin/sh -c&quot; prefix from the command string, it's works as well. 

anyway, let's just simplify to close this bug, and thanks for you support &amp; fix method, it's really a good experience for me. 


my conclusion is:
if we can run ant build from command line, it's should work from another command shell. the most important part is that we should provide a proper environment like add &quot;PATH&quot; to the command environment.


Thanks Sincerely.

Supressing this message should be supported (it's a trivial fix as posted in

Switch lines, failonerror

Building the API reference from source using the Sun JDK 1.4.2_19, javadoc crashes with a NullPointerException in ValueTaglet. As the build script does not fail on javadoc errors, an automated build process is likely to deliver an incomplete API reference.

The cause seems to be that src/main/org/apache/tools/ant/MagicNames.java contains a few doc comments which have @since before @value. Switching those lines solves the problem.

Below is the error message what I am getting: 

Error: JAVA_HOME is not defined correctly.
  We cannot execute /cygdrive/c/Java/jdk14/bin/java

I have set the JAVA_HOME properly and interesting thing is; I am able to run all
the java commands from the cygwin. 

It is clearly seen from ant.sh that you are setting JAVACMD like this:
JAVACMD=&quot;$JAVA_HOME/bin/java&quot;, which is correct. 

However when I try to execute the below command, I am getting the proper message.

I am able to reproduce this bug.

I am trying to compile a huge application(build takes 3 hours!!!!) with ANT.1.6.5 and with a XMLLogger in verbose mode. This is error occurs at the end of my build.so i my guess is that it is happening when you try to write the XMLLogger output.

I tried to do the same activity without verbose mode and its completes successfully.

Size of my xml log output(with verbose) :11.1 MB
Size of my xml log output(without verbose) :592 KB

I think, an unsuccessful task is not caught in the taskFinished() method, but
is caught in the targetFinished() method which is why you were able to catch 
the exception since you implemented it in the targetFinished() method.
I intend to catch errors in individual tasks within a target.

Correct me if I am mistaken.

I received this answer:

There is no possibility to reliably report a line number in case of a problem
with the encoding. After all, the bytes mapped onto LF may be in error too.
--- eoa ---

This sounds reasonable.
But I encountered this error sometimes, and everytime it occured, other
linenumbers were accurat.

Differences between MAC-OS, LINUX and WinDos would lead to following possibilities:
A calculated linenumber of 20 could mean the error is in line 20, in line 10 or
in line 40.
If I get a wrong linenumber, I could force an error, and find out the
relationship between mentioned line number and real line number.

But probably the linenumber is correct.

So a linenumber which is accurat most of the times and only in very few times
wrong would be more helpful, than no linenumber, which forces me to guess.

Perhaps I will not run into the user-error of wrong encoding again, after
finding out, that I have to specify 'iso-8859-1' encoding.

service pack for Windows with Ant, that's silly.  But when your program doesn't
work, or when a user cannot see output, I think you have a serious problem. 
Imagine if you wrote a Windows application that only ran at a resolution of
1280x1024 and announced to the world that anyone with Windows can run it!  But
when users downloaded it, some of them realized they couldn't run it because it
was made to run at only 1280x1024.  Well, I would say that's a serious flaw with
your software, and unless there was a really good reason for forcing 1280x1024
resolution for your software, it's probably a dumb idea.  

Excuse the crappy analogy, but nonetheless, I think it applies.  If you write an
app for Windows but don't take into account the limitations of Windows, you're
setting yourself and your users up for trouble.  Trust me, I'm not trying to
bash Ant, I know you guys wrote some code that I'm able to download for free and
play with, so obviously if I don't like it, you have no obligation to support
me.  It was simply a recommendation, that if you're going to design a program
for windows that's dependent on the evil MSDOS Command Prompt, then either
adjust the output of Ant so that it accomodates this limitation, or provide some
links or something to some software that will enable Ant to run a little more
gracefully under Windows.  In my case, I was running ant, but getting an error
message that I couldn't understand because it was beyond the border of my
command prompt.  That's a serious problem for Windows users running Ant.  In
most cases piping output or doing |more will work, but in this case, it didn't.
 For whatever reason, I guess stderr doesn't pipe to the more command.

So don't take it as me bashing your software, but instead read it as me making a
recommendation as a frustrated user.  I know Windows sucks for things like this,
and it must be a real headache, I sympathize.  But nothing would be better than
to have Ant performing as the most robust build system on all platforms.

Thanks again for all the recommendations, and continue the good work.
