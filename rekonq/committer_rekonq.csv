    So, best way I found is importing manually changes.

    Jonas Gastal started working on it in the 0.3 times, startin from CompletionBase code ..
    .. I did some work on another idea, proposing (in code) a new ""suggest engine"" created from scratch...
    dev122 finally merged our ideas and implemented what you are seeing (and improved it, too!)..
    
    - New suggestion items (Firefox style)
    - a mockup on the known urls (rekonq style)
    - for now, automatic Google and Wikipedia searches (more coming)..
    - a beautiful animation :)
    - quite all rough edges smoothed

    - removed previous SSL animation, we have now a nice yellow lock :)
    - faster and cleaner animations
    - reenabled the old stacked widget, to avoid stupid refreshes and fix some regressions
    - implemented some ""right icons"": KGet, SSL, RSS. For now, just SSL is full featured
    - clean up the box :) Some old & unuseful files removed, some icons added
    - Pano's request: grey text shown everytime in the empty bar
    
    Again and again:
    this is not the first, but the second implementation of the new urlbar UI.
    About me this is clearly better than the first or the previous.
    But it needs love :D

    1) users type strings --> we store them in QStrings
    2) app load urls --> we should ever work with KUrls, trying to guess users needs

    Basic cleaning and bug fixing of AdBlockRule.
    
    The options shoud be parsed before checking if the filter is a regexp,
    otherwhise a regexp with option will never match the rule.
    For example:
    -""/.*/$xmlhttprequest"" is a valid regexp that would not be matched.
    -""/.*$xmlhttprequest/"" is a valid regexp without options and the option
    should not have been parsed.
    
    The matching of the option should match the last index of ""$"", not the
    first, for the same reason as above.
    
    Use mid() to split the vector at once instead QString::mid() +
    QString::lef().

    Some ads were not filtered because they were incorrectly matched by
    the whitelist. This is because we ignore options, including the domain
    restrictions.
    
    For example, the white filter:
    @@||pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js$domain=kde.org
    would match any page regardless of the domain restriction. So no ads
    from pagead2.googlesyndication.com were filtered.
    
    This patch adds support for ""domain"" options in the fallback rules
    (the other AdBlockRuleImpl rejects options). The domain of the frame
    making the request is now compared to the option to take the right
    decision.
    
    This patch requires Qt 4.7 with a recent QtWebKit 2.0.

    This patch couples those merged in KIO & KDEWebKit in SC 4.6.
    I have to say it is probably NOT perfect and ready to merge, but I'd like to
    because it is anyway a nice step over actual behavior.
    
    It basically holds and (re)publish slave for apps needing it, letting us fixing
    a long standing bug against the infamous TWO connections to do ONE thing (download, move, etc...)
    
    It also gave me the possibility to and/or improve these things:
    - better handling filenames, studying content disposition header for ""attachment"" and ""inline"" values
    - better history handling, when working with kparts (also if this part needs a proper fix, IMHO reimplementing QWebHistory class...)
    - a (proper?) fix for POST operations returning content. I admit I am dubious with this part and I need more testing. The nice thing
    is that this patch ""circumscribes"" this problem, letting it easy eventually fix it again
    
    I also copied from kdewebkit a check for exec text files mimetypes (converted to text/plain) and cleaned-up some kDebugs
    (and as usual, added a lot..)
    
    Last, sorry for the big commit message and the big/not so big patch here. It is a special case.

    This patch should implement the UA switcher ability for rekonq.
    This is a first implementation, but it seems working quite well.
    It is based on KDE UA management and should be fully compatible with konqueror's one i.e.
    it should be possible using alternatively rekonq and konqueror sharing the same setting.
    
    Anyway, this is a different implementation from the konqueror's one. Simpler and based on the idea
    of a future moving to a plugin.

    Improvements:
    
    * title of the page is removed since it is visible on a tab.
    * widget now has a smooth 3d look'n'feel with Oxygen thanks to raisen frame
    * widget has rouned corners in all the styles
    * url of the page is elided
    * with compositing tab previews will be shown semitransparent with 25% alpha
    by default, witch can be setted to be optional later
    * code of tab preview is now separated from tab bar so it is more explicit

    This patch from Andrea Di Menna fixes UA description visualization in
    the UI.
    I changed it in two lines: fixed an empty string call using QL1S and
    removed i18n as we are in string freeze.
    Will need proper string translation after 0.8 stable release.

    When the Save As action is invoked on a KParts document (e.g. view

    Don't ask me why, as I'm not code author and it seems a bit complicated
    for the evening, but following backtrace (bug 289583, Thread 1, #12)

    This check prevents this crashy situation.

    We are just saving datas on our own, I don't like QtWebKit APIs
    to do it. We now call addHistoryEntry(url, title)
    on loadFinished.
    Data structure will remain the same as usual, but I think API
    is better and data are now saved when we really have them
    ready.
